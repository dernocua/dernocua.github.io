As a small dog nipped at my heels in the street, it occurred to me
that maybe magnetite might be denser than zinc oxide and also cheaper,
but [as it turns out magnetite is only 5.17 g/cc][6], slightly less
dense than zinc oxide.  Related fillers that really *are* higher
density include black cupric oxide (79.545 g/mol, 6.315 g/cc, boils at
2000°, -156 kJ/mol) and the safer but less air-stable red cuprous
oxide (143.09 g/mol, 6.0 g/cc, boils at 1800°, -170 kJ/mol), both of
which contain one oxygen and some copper (63.546 g/mol, 8.96 g/cc,
boils at 2562°).

Also, any of those four oxides could serve as an oxidizer for
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (cf. file
`shs-magnesium-phosphate.md`); magnetite is 231.533 g/mol and
[-1120.89 kJ/mol][7] (-280.223 kJ/mol O₁) and commonly used; zinc
oxide is 81.406 g/mol, 5.606 g/cc, and a very tame -350.5 kJ/mol, and
while it boils at 1974°, zinc metal boils at only 907°, which is why
welding on galvanized metal is dangerous.  In theory I ought to be
able to make black cupric oxide from recycled copper for AR$900/kg ×
63.546/79.545 ≈ AR$700/kg; copper dihydroxide (97.561 g/mol,
3.368 g/cc, -450 kJ/mol) dehydrates into cupric oxide at 80°.
