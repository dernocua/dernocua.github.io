I’m looking at [the RISC-V instruction set][0].  It seems kind of
boring, on purpose, in a good way, kind of like C and Golang.  There’s
intentionally very little that’s clever.

I’m surprised that it has no condition-code flags.  The authors
explain that this was one of their reasons for not using the OpenRISC
1000 instruction set (p. 15, 24 of 145):

> OpenRISC has condition codes and branch delay slots, which
> complicate higher performance implementations.
