The thermal aspect of this seems like an
eminently feasible thing to do with the intumescent refractory recipes
explored above: I can mix up some intumescent mix, maybe with a bunch
of vermiculite filler, mold it to a rough shape, and heat it with the
torch enough to get it to bubble up; then I can cut and grind it to
shape with saws, knives, bricks, bits of granite, and so on.  Maybe a
little hardfacing with waterglass-bonded sand or alumina would be
useful to improve durability, or maybe a bed of vermiculite would be
adequate.  That would already be a significant improvement over just
an open bowl of vermiculite or even the Monster-can forge.

Temperature control involves at a minimum some kind of electrical
circuit, probably a temperature sensor, and probably one or both of
airflow control (say, with muffin fans) and electrical heating, say
with a resistive heating element.  Blowing a variable amount of air
through ignited charcoal or some other burner (maybe an oil burner
like the one I made with the porous magnesium silicate) could add a
variable amount of heat to the chamber; mixing that air with a second
airstream could control the air temperature

Once I can do that, probably making further components from ceramic
should be easy.
