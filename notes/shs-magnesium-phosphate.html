(3 minutes)</div><p>According to doi:10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00463, one of the difficulties
with magnesium cements using phosphoric acid is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These reactions are highly, often violently, exothermic, which
raises practical challenges regarding the use of this process on a
large scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically they’re talking about MgO + 2H₃PO₄ + H₂O →
Mg(H₂PO₄)₂·2H₂O, which is soluble, and MgO + H₃PO₄ + 2H₂O →
MgHPO₄·3H₂O, which is not.</p>
<p>“Highly, often violently, exothermic” sounds great for
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, and both MgO and H₃PO₄
are solid at ordinary temperatures.  But where do you get the water?</p>
<p>Aside from preparing the mix well below 0°, a possible alternative is
to use a hygroscopic magnesium salt rather than the oxide.  Magnesium
chloride is annoyingly hygroscopic, as I’ve been experiencing today
(normally a hexahydrate), and Epsom salt (normally a heptahydrate)
actually has an <em>undecahydrate</em>, Fritzsche’s salt, which melts at 2°.
So even a little bit of the hygroscopic salt might be adequate.
Magnesium nitrate is so hygroscopic it can’t even be dehydrated by
heating.  The bromide is outright deliquescent.</p>
<p>Another possibility is the oxalate, which is normally a dihydrate and
decomposes to the oxide on heating.</p>
<p>So, for example, maybe you could use 5MgO + 2(MgSO₄·7H₂O) + H₃PO₄.</p>
<p>A different way to use this rapid cementation reaction might be to
spray aqueous phosphoric acid (or dissolved phosphates of ammonia)
onto a powder bed containing an MgO or Mg(OH)₂ binder, and a filler
such as quartz, in order to 3-D print.  The paper also mentions
rapid-setting magnesium phosphate cements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although earlier patents and articles used liquid polyphosphates or
diammonium phosphate, by the late 1980s, MgO and powdered
monoammonium phosphate were the preferred materials, shipped as dry
powders, principally forming a crystalline struvite binding phase
when mixed with water, according to eq 12.134 ... Addition of water
to a blend of monoammonium phosphate and MgO results in a mass that
sets too rapidly to be of use, and thus, early MAP patch repair
cements used a separately packaged ammonium polyphosphate solution
that reacted more slowly with the MgO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, these form the wimpy struvite rather than phosphates of just
magnesium.</p>
<p>It also mentions that sodium dihydrogenphosphate (monosodium
phosphate) is twice as soluble as the ammonium salt (MAP), which is
57% more soluble than the potassium salt.</p>
<p>The magnesium salts that are easy to find here are the citrate, the
carbonate (gym chalk), the chloride, and the sulfate, which (being
fertilizer) is cheapest: US$1/kg, oddly cheaper than even dolomite.
The oxide <em>is</em> available but only in an expensive food-grade form.
The nitrate is also available as fertilizer, but costs much more than
the sulfate.</p>
