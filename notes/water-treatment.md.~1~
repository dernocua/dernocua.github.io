Those costs actually sound very reasonable.

At first I misread your comment to be saying that it would take US$575000 of catalyst to provide clean water to 5000 people, when actually you seem to have been saying that it would provide clean water to 200k people (200 mgd), a cost of US$2.87 per person, which is low enough that almost anybody in the world could pay it rather than exposing themselves to waterborne pathogens.  Moreover, I think the real situation is substantially better than your comment suggests, for four reasons:

① what seems to have been a calculation error on your part resulting in a cost estimate that is too high by a factor of about 60;

② people's drinking water needs are lower than you suggest by a factor of about 65, although conventional surface-water treatment plants cannot take advantage of this;

③ you're not taking into account the supply-chain issues;

④ unless the catalyst gets poisoned within a few months, even your US$2.87/person figure is already several times smaller than the consumable costs for conventional surface-water treatment facilities.  

Thanks to mkr-hn I found the paper at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352882305_A_residue-free_approach_to_water_disinfection_using_catalytic_in_situ_generation_of_reactive_oxygen_species; the supplementary

First, you say 0.5 MGD is 6.5 million times higher than the 0.2 mℓ/s 

Conventional surface-water treatment facilities involve treatment with hypochlorite, permanganate, chloramine, and whatnot in existing waterworks, but it's still and it doesn't require a continuous supply chain for these materials, which pose some safety concerns (especially at small scales) and in many places are subject to legal reporting requirements.

They do say their catalyst is 0.5% Au and 0.5% Pd on a TiO₂ support, so I think you're reading it correctly: 0.6 mg of gold and 0.6 mg of palladium to process 0.2 mℓ/min of water.  Supplementary material at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00642-w seems to be https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41929-021-00642-w/MediaObjects/41929_2021_642_MOESM1_ESM.pdf has a plot of different catalyst mixes they tried (Sup. Fig. 14, p. 12, 13/32).

If we normalize that amount of catalyst metal to SI units, that's 3 gram seconds per liter (g·s/ℓ) each of gold and palladium.  Your 0.5 MGD (22 ℓ/s) for 5000 people is 4.4 mℓ/s per person, which works out to 13 mg each of gold and palladium per person.  Palladium at US$2800 per troy ounce (https://www.kitco.com/charts/livepalladium.html — that *is* per troy ounce, isn't it?) is US$90/g.  Gold at US$1800 per troy ounce is US$58/g.  Multiplying it out, that's US$1.20 of palladium per person and US$0.76 of gold per person, for a total of US$1.95 of catalyst metals per person.

This figure is substantially less than your computation of US$125 

However, that's 380 liters per day per person, and Burning Man recommends 1.5 gallons per day per person (5.7 liters/day/person, 0.066 mℓ/s/person), which includes water for for showers, for cooking, and for drinking in a very dry environment with extensive physical exertion, though not for bidets.  That's almost two orders of magnitude lower.  Maybe your waterworks is supplying not only drinking water but also toilet-flushing water and lawn-irrigating water?  Those don't normally need antibacterial treatment.  Even the benchtop device they used in the paper would supply three people's water needs at Burning Man rates.



Being able to operate in practical terms at a very small scale seems to me like an advantage rather than a disadvantage.
