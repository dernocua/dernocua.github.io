"The cost of Chinaâ€™s new nuclear ambition has been estimated at US$440 billion."  But it doesn't say how much power that is, just that it's 150 new reactors, so it's about US$3B per reactor.  https://archive.md/A5B6S shows that the article didn't say how much power it was 9 hours ago either.  So, is this 15 GW, 150 GW, or 1500 GW?

PV modules are about US$0.2/W, so if it were PV panels, US$440B would buy them 2.2 terawatts peak.  At an average capacity factor of 20% that would be 440 GW, but China's historical PV capacity factor has been terrible, more like 12% IIRC (maybe due to a Chinese version of the irrational misregulation robomartin documents in California in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29155094), which would make it more like 260 GW.  But a PV power plant includes things that aren't panels; balance of plant (inverter, wiring, grid connection, monitoring, mounting, security) is typically roughly equal to the module cost.  So it would be more like 130 GW.

In the US, nuclear plants cost about US$10/W
