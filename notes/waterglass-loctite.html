(1 minute)</div><p>Loctite polymerizes in the presence of metal ions, which is how it
hardens in the screw threads but not in the plastic bottle.  Guess
what else solidifies in the presence of (polyvalent) metal ions?
Solutions of soluble silicates: waterglass!</p>
<p>Suppose waterglass by itself in a screw thread doesn’t harden because
the metal surface doesn’t spontaneously oxidize just because it’s wet?
Even if galvanic corrosion isn’t a viable source of cations, maybe the
surface can be induced to oxidize with some kind of nasty oxidizing
anions.  For example, maybe you can use sodium chloride, potassium
sulfate, ammonium acetate, or some crossbreed of them to provoke
oxidation of iron, brass, or aluminum.  Only a tiny amount of
oxidation is necessary, only enough iron ions to precipitate the
silicate, which itself should be present in only the minimal quantity
required to achieve the desired bond strength.</p>
<p>Another interesting possibility I haven’t tried is baking soda.
Waterglass hardens in seconds upon contact with carbonic acid, and
baking soda releases carbonic acid upon being heated above 50°,
leaving behind its conjugate base, the more basic soda ash.  Perhaps
this reaction could solidify waterglass in a thread if you heat the
whole assembly above 50°?  I suspect that the carbonic acid solidifies
the waterglass by dropping the pH, and if that’s the case, it will not
work.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/manufacturing.html">Manufacturing</a> (29 notes)
