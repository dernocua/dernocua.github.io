00:12 <@oriansj> danderson: the distinction between stage0 and stage0-posix is that stage0 is bare metal only and stage0-posix is only 
                 depending on a POSIX kernel that supports the following syscalls: exit, execve, fork, waitpid, brk, open, close, read, 
                 write, lseek, chmod for up to M2-Planet+mescc-tools (excluding Kaem) but mescc-tools-extra+Kaem needs fchmod, access, 
                 chdir, fchdir, mkdir, mknod, getcwd, umask and uname. Mes also needs unlink, ioctl,
00:12 <@oriansj> stat and fsync (assuming I didn't miss anything janneke )
00:14 < stikonas> tcc probably wouldn't add any new syscalls...
00:14 < stikonas> since tcc uses mes libc
00:14 < stikonas> so maybe one can just go to tcc instead of mescc
00:15 <@oriansj> And the initial kernel could be written in Assembly or in the C subset that M2-Planet running on bare metal supports
00:15 <@oriansj> stikonas: mes-m2 doesn't use all of the syscalls in meslibc but TCC supposdedly does
01:18 <@oriansj> danderson: well the Kaem shell does only execute serially but it doesn't support pipes (as they aren't needed until 
                 after TCC)
01:20 <@oriansj> And multitasking doesn't need to extend beyond process runs until it forks or exits. If forked, just sleep until forked 
                 process is done. (as it is just doing waitpid)
01:22 <@oriansj> but yes, such a kernel wouldn't be designed to be usable by humans but rather the bare subset of perfect programs that 
                 never have bugs or problems bootstrapping a more advanced kernel.
01:27 < fossy> pipes are an intentional non feature
01:27 < fossy> to reduce kernel requirements
01:40 <@oriansj> exec, exit, fork and waitpid are the minimal subset required for having processes spawned from a shell to do work. brk 
                 is needed if you want a non-fixed amount of memory. open, close, read, write, lseek are the minimal subset required for 
                 working with files. chmod is only needed on filesystems that require the executable bit to be set to execute binaries. 
                 chdir and getcwd are needed for the shell to change directories and not have
01:40 <@oriansj> everything be done in absolute addresses. uname is needed to have architecture/OS specific behaviors (get_machine not 
                 absolutely required) mkdir needed for mkdir and untar. The remainder could be removed with some effort should it come 
                 down to that.
14:35 < stikonas> xentrac: where is ioctl used?
14:35 < stikonas> I didn't find any usage of it
14:38 < stikonas> oh, there is one call isatty
14:38 < stikonas> that's probably not important...
14:42 < stikonas> xentrac: I think it's only used to determine whether mes should start interactive hsell or not
14:43 < stikonas> can easily stub it out
