on spherical wheels</a> composed of
independently rotating hemispheres in order to be able to roll in one
direction controlled by a drive axle and a second direction freely; he
built a vehicle with three such wheels that could move in any
direction.  In the center of each hemisphere he included an additional
wheel, copied from a design at Osaka University.  And it occurred to
me: what about a toroidal wheel to be able to do the same trick?</p>
<p>Not such a novel idea, I guess, with the diagonal rollers.  But what
if the rollers around the edge of the wheel simply rotate
perpendicular to the torus’s axis?  The torus can be driven on that
axis and consist of four or more rollers around the outside whose axes
of rotation form a regular polygon.  Perhaps if there are many of them
they can even overlap one another.  Bruton’s spheres contain sort of a
degenerate version of this: the torus has been stripped of all but two
rollers, and the rest of the torus is covered with the hemispheres.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/contrivances.html">Contrivances</a> (45 notes)
