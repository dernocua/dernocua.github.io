(1 minute)</div><p>You could integrate a multiturn potentiometer into a planetary screw
without occupying extra space, though plausibly this is a bad idea.
One or more of the planets is metallic or otherwise strongly
conductive, one of the threads on the continuous track (the nut for an
inverse planetary screw, the screw for the normal type) is resistive,
and the other linear element (the screw for an inverse planetary
screw, the nut for the normal type) is conductive.  This gives you
ratiometric positional feedback and a potentiometer without sliding
contact (and thus plausibly longer life than potentiometers normally
have, though I suppose that if this is beneficial then there must be
existing ball-bearing or gear potentiometers).</p>
<p>This might involve undesirable compromises to mechanical properties.
Probably the best material for the planets is either conductive or
non-conductive, so making one of them conductive represents a
compromise.  And needing to make most of one of the long linear
elements insulating may be a drawback, since metals are plausibly
better materials for them.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/contrivances.html">Contrivances</a> (45 notes)
