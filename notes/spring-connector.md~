Watched an Abom79 video I'd seen before tonight which featured a
parting blade with replaceable inserts.  A parting blade doesn't have
a lot of space for holding down an insert; you can't put a big screw
in there, for example.  So the insert was wedged into a sort of
two-tine fork, which flexes elastically to admit it.
