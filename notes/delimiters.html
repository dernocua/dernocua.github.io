(1 minute)</div><p>Suppose you’re parsing a token stream containing nested delimiters,
like (a b (c (d) e ((f g))) h), storing the tokens as you go, and
you’d like to store information about the nesting structure in the
stored tokens themselves, which are of some fixed size.</p>
<p>You can clearly get by with a previous-sibling pointer and a
previous-parent pointer, populated online as you parse the string, if
you’re going to traverse the string backwards; on close delimiters,
you could repurpose the previous-parent pointer as a last-child
pointer, since if you want the parent you could just follow the
previous-sibling pointer to the matching open delimiter and use <em>its</em>
parent pointer.  When adding a close delimiter and thus ending a
level, to find the matching open delimiter, simply leap to the last
delimiter or delimiter pair within the level now ending and ask them
for their parent; when adding a new open delimiter, look at the
previous delimiter, and if it was a close delimiter, it is your
sibling and tells you your parent; if it was an open delimiter, it is
your parent and you have no siblings yet.  This permits building the
structure in linear time with only a single pointer to leap over the
trailing non-delimiter tokens with.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (49 notes)
