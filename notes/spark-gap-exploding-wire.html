(1 minute)</div><p>Sometimes a spark gap is used as a trigger for an exploding wire, but
it occurred to me that maybe you can do it the other way around: use
an exploding wire to trigger a spark gap.</p>
<p>If you mechanically put a thin wire <em>partway</em> across a near-breakdown
spark gap, you will get corona discharge around the end of the wire,
which will supply ions to seed the arc and tend to start forming a
streamer.  If that glow discharge turns into an arc, the wire will
start to heat up, and if it’s thin enough, it will explode into
plasma, completing the arc.</p>
<p>If the wire manages to bridge the spark gap completely instead of
partly, then it might develop a hot spot where it touches one or the
other electrode, which could melt it down to a round knob that’s too
round to create corona discharge and too close to the electrode for
avalanche to kick in (below the Paschen minimum).  Possibly a small
inductor in series with the wire (but only the wire, not the spark gap
itself) would avoid this danger.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/electronics.html">Electronics</a> (39 notes)
