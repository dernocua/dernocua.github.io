In my childhood, I used a mechanical typewriter with no exclamation
mark “!”.  It did have a vertical apostrophe “'” which was nearly
right, lacking only the dot at the bottom.  The solution was to type a
“'”, press the backspace key, and then type “.”, thus creating an
exclamation mark on the paper.  If memory serves, it also had an
underscore key used in the same way to produce underlined text.

Traditional printers (including the ASR-33) are equipped with this
ability to “overstrike”, typically using backspace or a carriage
return without an accompanying line feed, which permitted them to do
boldface, accented letters, and underlining, without any dedicated
electronics or mechanics for those purposes.  Some also implemented
superscript and subscript with a half-linefeed feature, so you could
write x² or xᵢ in a more or less readable way — although these were
the same font size due to mechanical limitations.  APL used this
overstrike capability to create an unlimited variety of new operator
symbols; for example, by overstriking Δ with |, you could get ⍋, the
ascending-sort-order operator.

Most glass terminals did not implement this feature, because taking an
arbitrarily long period of time to compose a glyph was not very
compatible with scanning out pixels in real time to a CRT electron
beam.  Instead, “printing” a new character at the location of an
existing character simply replaced it.  While this removed the ability
to overstrike, it made it possible to do real-time screen editing,
updating any part of the screen to contain arbitrary new contents.
One exception was [the PLATO V terminals for the University of
Illinois PLATO project][0]; these used gas-plasma screens with
8080-driven framebuffers, and they *did* support overstrike, doing a
bitwise OR of the various characters in a character cell, an ability
PLATO users used to compose a variety of creative cartoons.

Replacing characters in this way was not ergonomically optimal for
human editing of text, since although we do occasionally replace some
text with other text consisting of the same number of characters, it’s
much more common to insert text, delete text, or replace text with
text of some other length.XXX
