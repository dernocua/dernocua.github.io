(1 minute)</div><p>Curiously, I just realized I haven’t heard of clay-filled PLA filament
before, but it turns out that <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/11/10/1947/htm" title="3D Printing of PLA/clay Nanocomposites: Influence of Printing Temperature on Printed Samples Properties">it does exist</a>; the clay increases
shear thinning, thermal stability, crystallinity, and rigidity, and
<a href="https://shop.thevirtualfoundry.com/products/amaco-46-d-ceramic-clay-filamet?variant=29457842733139">at 40% clay the print can be fired to ceramic</a>, though melt
viscosity increases.  Other mineral fillers currently on sale include
zircon and sapphire, both of which claim to be sinterable in the same
way.  I’d think that including clay would also lower the cost and
increase strength without firing, but that doesn’t seem to be the case
yet; in this experiment the clay actually decreased tensile strength
in most cases by 5-20%.</p>
<p>They bought a prefunctionalized clay whose preparation I don’t
understand at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For nanocomposites preparation, an organo-modified layered silicate
  (Cloisite 30B, Southern ClayProducts Inc., Gonzales, TX, USA),
  modified by methyl, tallow, bis-2-hydroxyethyl, and quaternary
  ammonium chloride, having a basal interlayer spacing d001 = 18.5 Å,
  was used.</p>
