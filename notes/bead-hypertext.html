(1 minute)</div><p>The PDF standard (since PDF 1.1) has the amusing terminology of
“beads” on a “thread” of “articles”.  I think “bead” might be better
than “line” or “card” or “page” for my card-based hypertext thing
(suggesting perhaps its intellectual descent from wampum).</p>
<p>And indeed the meaning in PDF is closely related:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some types of documents may contain sequences of content items that
are logically connected but not physically sequential.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE 1: A news story may begin on the first page of a newsletter
and run over onto one or more nonconsecutive interior pages.</p>
<p>To represent such sequences of physically discontiguous but
logically related items, a PDF document may define one or more
articles (PDF 1.1). The sequential flow of an article shall be
defined by an article thread; the individual content items that make
up the article are called beads on the thread. Conforming readers
may provide navigation facilities to allow the user to follow a
thread from one bead to the next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beads are “chained” with “N (next) and V (previous) [attributes]”,
while they link to their actual contents with “P” for the page object
and “R” for the rectangle on the page.</p>
<p><em>My</em> intent, of course, is to eliminate or ephemeralize the physical
sequence entirely, rather than to simply superimpose a secondary
sequence on it.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (49 notes)
