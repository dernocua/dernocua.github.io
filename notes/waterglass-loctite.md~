Loctite polymerizes in the presence of metal ions, which is how it
hardens in the screw threads but not in the plastic bottle.  Guess
what else solidifies in the presence of (polyvalent) metal ions?
Solutions of soluble silicates: waterglass!

Suppose waterglass by itself in a screw thread doesn't harden because
the iron surface doesn't spontaneously oxidize just because it's wet?
Maybe the iron surface can be induced to oxidize with some kind of
nasty iron-oxidizing anions.  For example, maybe you can use sodium
chloride.
