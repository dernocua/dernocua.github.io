Watching [an Abom79 video][0] I saw an interesting way of fastening
parts together with friction: one part has a slot in it that's too
small for the other part, but round holes on both sides of the slot.
By using a simple hand tool with two round pins that fit in the holes,
one of which is mounted on an eccentric, you can exert a very large
force to elastically bend the slot open.
