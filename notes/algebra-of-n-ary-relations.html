(4 minutes)</div><p>(Based on Jamie Brandon’s <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-sets-and-funs/">Imp</a> and some unpublished work of Dave
Long’s based on Hehner’s <em>Practical Theory of Programming</em>.)</p>
<p>Consider N-ary relations like those of the relational algebra, treated
as sets of equal-arity tuples.  (Maybe they could be bags instead of
sets; I’m not sure.)  It’s convenient to assume some set of atomic
items to make these tuples out of, such as words, symbols, or numbers.
We can treat an atom as a degenerate relation: <code>a</code> is taken to be the
relation consisting of a single tuple containing the atom <code>a</code>.</p>
<p>From these atoms we can build nonempty single-column relations with a
union operator <code>+</code>: <code>a+b+d</code> is a single-column relation consisting of
three one-item tuples <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>d</code>, in no particular order, so
it’s equal to <code>a+d+b</code> or <code>d+b+a</code>.  (If we rule out multisets, it’s
also idempotent, so <code>a+b+d+a+b+d</code> is also equal.)</p>
<p>By adding a cartesian-product operator with higher precedence, written
simply with juxtaposition, we can build multiple-column relations: <code>x
y z</code> is a three-column relation consisting of a single tuple with the
atoms <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, in that order.  This operator is associative,
so <code>(x y) z</code> is equal to <code>x (y z)</code>, but not commutative; the order of
columns matters, so, for example, <code>y z</code> ≠ <code>z y</code>, and <code>x y z</code> ≠ <code>x z
y</code>.</p>
<p>We give the implied operator of juxtaposition cartesian-product
semantics simply by declaring that it distributes over <code>+</code>, so <code>(a +
b) (c + d)</code> = <code>a (c + d) + b (c + d)</code> = <code>a c + a d + b c + b d</code>.  This
also gives us a normalization procedure for relations built up in this
way, which makes equivalence decidable.</p>
<p>Now we can introduce identity elements for these two operations;
capitalizing the names from Imp, we can declare that None is a
relation with no rows, and Some is a relation containing only the
empty tuple.  (A different choice of notation might use {} for None
and () for Some, or α for Some and ω for None.)  For any relation X,
<code>None + X</code> = <code>X</code>, and <code>Some X</code> = <code>X Some</code> = <code>X</code>.  I think it’s
provable from this that <code>None X</code> = <code>X None</code> = <code>None</code>, but if not,
let’s postulate it — it’s obviously necessary for juxtaposition to
give us the usual kind of cartesian product.</p>
<p>We’ve said that we’re interested in sets of <em>equal-arity</em> tuples, but
there’s nothing stopping us from writing <code>a + b c</code>, though that has a
straightforward interpretation as a set containing a 1-tuple and a
2-tuple.  For the time being we’ll just consider such expressions as
being uninteresting due to being “ill-typed”, but clearly enough if we
leave them in with that interpretation, we have the
Kleene-closure-free regular expressions.</p>
<p>This is nearly a Boolean algebra, with juxtaposition for ∧, <code>+</code> for ∨,
None for 0, and Some for 1; but the ∧ of a Boolean algebra must be
commutative, and it’s not clear to me how to define ¬ such that <em>a</em> ∨
¬<em>a</em> = 1 and <em>a</em> ∧ ¬<em>a</em> = 0 (<code>X + !X = Some</code> and <code>X !X = None</code>).</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> a semiring, though, at least if we sweep the “typing” problem
under the rug; we have associativity of both operators, commutativity
of <code>+</code>, distributivity, identity elements, and annihilation.  In fact,
it’s pretty much just the free semiring on whatever our atoms are.  If
we rule out multisets, it’s the free idempotent semiring, which
induces a partial order on the operations.</p>
<p>The two operators above are two of the five primitive operators of
Codd’s relational algebra; the other three are selection, projection,
and set difference (set intersection being derived from union and
difference).</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (49 notes)
