I’m reminded of the grad student dollar auction and the up-and-out
rule at top accounting firms: tenure is well paid, secure, and highly
competitive, and the way you compete for it is by working for many
years as a poorly paid and insecure grad student (and, in some fields,
postgrad).  And if you don’t get a professorship or tenure you get
kicked out, first of the university and then possibly out of the
university system entirely, which people respond to by throwing good
“money” (in the form of work) after bad.  So in a sense for this guy
Intel was grad school and the bank job was the professorship.</p>
<p>Dollar auctions are widely known for </p>
<p>In many countries, up-and-out is illegal, though with an exception for
universities.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/incentives.html">Incentives</a> (5 notes)
