A clay wire cutter makes curved cuts.  If it enters a planar surface
of a clay block all at once while it is pulled taut, the cut starts
out straight, but if it enters incrementally, the cut can start out
curved; and of course the path on which it is pulled through the clay
can also be curved.

The cut path has a tendency to have negative Gaussian curvature as
initial wiggles in the wire tend to straighten out.
