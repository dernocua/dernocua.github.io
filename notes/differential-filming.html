(1 minute)</div><p>Illuminating an area with a somewhat bright flash produces more
brightness on objects closer to the flash.  By arithmetically
subtracting a non-flash-illuminated frame from a flash-illuminated
frame, you can extrapolate what the scene would look like if the flash
were the only illumination.  This could be useful to provide
illumination for actors, etc., that isn’t visible in a photograph or
motion picture.  This probably isn’t useful for confidentiality, since
brighter areas of the subtracted background will have larger amounts
of noise in the subtraction result, but it could provide dramatic
lighting effects, even permitting after-the-fact lighting adjustment.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> (14 notes)
