<p>Suppose you want reactive magnesia in order to make, for example,
Sorel cement for X-ray 3-D printing (see <a href="../notes/sorel-cement-3dp.html">Can you 3-D print Sorel cement by inhibiting setting with X-rays?</a>),
or exothermic refractory magnesium phosphate cement (see <a href="../notes/shs-magnesium-phosphate.html">SHS of magnesium phosphate</a>) , but it isn’t sold locally, but other
soluble magnesium salts are available.  What can you do?</p>
<p>Well, calcining the carbonate or the hydroxide produces magnesia at
only 350°, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_carbonate#Preparation">according to WP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnesium carbonate can be prepared in laboratory by reaction
between any soluble magnesium salt and sodium bicarbonate... If
magnesium chloride (or sulfate) is treated with aqueous sodium
carbonate, a precipitate of basic magnesium carbonate—a hydrated
complex of magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide—rather than
magnesium carbonate itself is formed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So magnesium oxide can be made with a soluble carbonate or bicarbonate
(such as baking soda) plus the citrate, the chloride, or the sulfate
of magnesium, thus forming the carbonate of magnesium (possibly, or
possibly the bicarbonate), and just a bit of heat.  Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_oxide">WP also
says</a> that if you don’t heat it to at least 700° it’s so reactive
that it will recarbonate from the air.</p>
<p>An alternative alkali-free approach is taken in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFG-nXUw6Ts">Kiwami Japan’s
“sharpest Seawater kitchen knife in the world”</a>.  They begin by
boiling down the filtered seawater twice to crystallize some salts
(presumably sodium chloride?) which are filtered out, leaving a
solution of mostly magnesium chloride (solubility 72.6 g/100mℓ at
100°, twice NaCl’s 36 g/100mℓ).</p>
<p>Then they calcine seashells in a microwave-oven kiln made of
insulating firebrick, using charcoal as the susceptor rather than (or
perhaps in addition to) the more conventional silicon carbide, for 15'
at 1000 W, reaching a bright yellow heat, twice.  This yields pure
white quicklime seashells, which are ground to a granulometry around
100 μm using a mortar and pestle and a meat grinder.  This heats from
25° to 65° upon hydration with water from a cow-shaped pitcher.  A
little limewater (1.5 g/ℓ slaked lime) is decanted and filtered off.</p>
<p>Adding some limewater to concentrated seawater (containing a
significant amount of magnesium chloride) precipitates some magnesium
hydroxide (solubility 0.00064 g/100mℓ) over the next 30', which is
filtered off, along with some sodium chloride.  This is washed with
water from another cow-shaped pitcher to remove the salt, dried, and
ground to get dry magnesium hydroxide, which is then moistened with
magnesium chloride solution to produce a weak Sorel cement (11 Shore
D).  Calcining the hydroxide in the microwave-oven kiln (with charcoal
as susceptor, 15', 1000W, heating to a yellow heat measured as 970°
with a pyrometer) yields the oxide.  Moistening the oxide with the
chloride solution yields a much harder Sorel cement (102-109 Shore D,
but I think that may be as high as his meter goes).</p>
<p>An open rectangular mold was filled with this cement and vibrated with
a Handy Massager to remove bubbles; when set, the demolded rectangle
was cut with an abrasive wire saw into the rough shape of a kitchen
knife.  While wearing rubber gloves equipped with reptilian claws, a
gavel was used to drive a scrap of Sorel cement through the top of an
Altoids tin, damaging the face of the gavel.  The knife blank was then
ground with a series of files and abrasives to form the knife edge,
which then successfully cut a cucumber extruded from the reptilian
glove.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talisman.org/~erlkonig/misc/microwave-metal-casting.html">David Reid’s experiments with “Microwave melting of metals”</a> found
that magnetite works well as a susceptor for microwave-oven kilns,
more efficiently than graphite, up to 900° (though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite">its Curie point is
only 580°</a>, and you would expect it to become transparent to
microwaves above that temperature).  He reports that the magnetite
tends to flux the sand and melt it, though.  His use of uninsulated
crucibles explains the need for more-efficient susceptors; Kiwami
Japan’s use of a few centimeters of insulating refractory ceramic
avoids this problem.  Previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419035439/home.c2i.net/metaphor/rt.html">Reid had used ceramic-fiber
furnaces</a>.</p>
<p>Some other recent work has used graphene paint as a susceptor.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (59 notes)
