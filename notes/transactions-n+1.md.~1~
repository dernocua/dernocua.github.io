Reading [a note on Rust for web
APIs](https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html) I ran across the
"n+1" problem, familiar to anyone whoâ€™s done database-backed web
sites: 

> The n+1 problem is something that everyone building web applications
> should understand. The gist is: you have a page of photos (1
> query). You want to show the author of each photo. How many queries
> do you end up with: 1, combining the photos & authors, or a query
> per photo to get the author after retrieving the photos? Or 2
> queries, with the second having something like user.id IN ids to
> fetch all authors in a single pass and then reconnect them to their
> photos.
