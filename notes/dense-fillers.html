(7 minutes)</div><p>Making things feel heavy is cool because people feel like light things
are cheap and worthless.  But there are cheap high-density fillers.</p>
<p>One of the very cheap things Ecoquimica sells (see <a href="../notes/material-observations.html">Material observations</a>) is baryte.  I was thinking I didn’t have
any use for that, but it occurs to me that it might be useful as a
high-density filler, with density theoretically
4.48 g/cc.  And at Mohs 3–3.5 it should be easy to mill to finer
granulometry.  Baryte-filled silicone might be 3.4 g/cc and ought to
be a bright, pure white, and much less resonant than pure or
quartz-filled silicone.  I see it’s also used for X-ray shielding, for
making the first synthetic phosphor, <em>Lapis Boloniensis</em> (through
carbothermal reduction to the anomalously water-soluble barium
sulfide, which doesn’t melt until 2235°), and as a metal-casting mold
release (melts at 1580°, decomposes at 1600°), as well as a source of
barium for other materials like the remarkable and dangerous BaO₂.
I’m wary of using it in reactions, though, because of barium
heavy-metal toxicity.</p>
<p>For just adding weight and whiteness to things, zinc oxide (5.6 g/cc)
might be superior, and is also interesting for oxychloride and
phosphate uses, but from Ecoquimica it costs AR$5200/kg (US$29/kg) to
baryte’s AR$83/kg (46¢/kg).  Other vendors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite">have it for lower prices
like AR$1500/kg</a> but nothing in the neighborhood of baryte.  And if
you <em>just</em> want density, you can get scrap lead, copper, and steel
pretty cheap; a <a href="https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C1309382&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=2">30kg lead ingot</a> is AR$13500 (AR$450/kg,
US$75/30kg, US$2.50/kg), and I’m pretty sure the scrap metal guy
around the corner pays something like AR$950/kg for copper, AR$700/kg
for brass, and AR$100/kg for lead, all of which are more expensive
than baryta (but denser).  Steel is too cheap for him to even deal
with.</p>
<p>For building machine tool frames, baryta’s vibration-damping and
density properties might be highly desirable.</p>
<p>As a small dog nipped at my heels in the street, it occurred to me
that maybe magnetite might be denser than zinc oxide and also cheaper,
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite">as it turns out magnetite is only 5.17 g/cc</a>, slightly less
dense than zinc oxide.  Related fillers that really <em>are</em> higher
density include black cupric oxide (79.545 g/mol, 6.315 g/cc, boils at
2000°, -156 kJ/mol) and the safer but less air-stable red cuprous
oxide (143.09 g/mol, 6.0 g/cc, boils at 1800°, -170 kJ/mol), both of
which contain one oxygen and some copper (63.546 g/mol, 8.96 g/cc,
boils at 2562°).</p>
<p>Also, any of those four oxides could serve as an oxidizer for
self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (cf. <a href="../notes/shs-magnesium-phosphate.html">SHS of magnesium phosphate</a>); magnetite is 231.533 g/mol and
<a href="https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C1309382&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=2">-1120.89 kJ/mol</a> (-280.223 kJ/mol O₁) and commonly used; zinc
oxide is 81.406 g/mol, 5.606 g/cc, and a very tame -350.5 kJ/mol, and
while it boils at 1974°, zinc metal boils at only 907°, which is why
welding on galvanized metal is dangerous.  In theory I ought to be
able to make black cupric oxide from recycled copper for AR$900/kg ×
63.546/79.545 ≈ AR$700/kg; copper dihydroxide (97.561 g/mol,
3.368 g/cc, -450 kJ/mol) dehydrates into cupric oxide at 80°.</p>
<p>On 02021-08-24 I walked by the neighborhood recycler (“COMPRO METALES,
X MAYOR Y MENOR, Pago Mas!...”) to check on scrap prices.  He’s
offering AR$600/kg for brass and bronze (US$3.3/kg), AR$100/kg for
aluminum (56¢/kg), AR$170/kg for lead (95¢/kg), and AR$900/kg for
batteries (US$5.0/kg), which it turns out refers to lead-acid
batteries, not disposable alkaline batteries (mostly manganese dioxide
and zinc) — the 95¢/kg is the price for other lead, I guess things
like tire weights, while the factory buys back the dead batteries for
more than US$5/kg, presumably because of the high-purity lead content.
He’s not buying copper at all today, it looks like; I wonder if that
means he has scrap copper he can’t sell?</p>
<p>I've made copper hydroxide in the past by electrolysis, mixed,
probably, with cupric chloride and the acetate, both of which are
water-soluble, which should make separation easy.  (Cuprous chloride
is less water-soluble, but its K<sub>sp</sub> is still 1.72 × 10⁻⁷, 13
orders of magnitude more than cupric hydroxide’s 2.20 × 10⁻²⁰, and at
any rate it’s difficult to make.)  If my objective were to make a lot
of pure cupric oxide, I could use a plain vinegar electrolyte or a
sulfate electrolyte to eliminate the chlorides.  I bet Mina would
appreciate the pigment, too.</p>
<p>So the points on the Pareto tradeoff curve for density to cost are
something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Osmium: <a href="https://www.metalary.com/osmium-price/">US$13000/kg</a>, 22.65 g/cc, or possibly iridium at more
  than twice that price</li>
<li>Tungsten: <a href="https://www.metalary.com/tungsten-price/">US$30/kg</a>, 19.3 g/cc</li>
<li>Tungsten carbide?  Not sure what it costs but its density is 15.6 g/cc.</li>
<li>Lead scrap: 95¢/kg, 11.3 g/cc</li>
<li>Steel scrap: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/iron-and-steel-scrap-statistics-and-information">21¢/kg</a>, 7.9 g/cc</li>
<li>Magnetite: <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/nmic/iron-ore-statistics-and-information">10¢/kg</a> <a href="https://stockhead.com.au/resources/barry-fitzgerald-why-magnetite-is-hot-and-whos-making-it/">or so</a>, 5.2 g/cc</li>
<li>Quartz (as construction sand): 3¢/kg, 2.6 g/cc</li>
<li>Water: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here/">.06¢/kg</a> or so, 1 g/cc</li>
</ul>
<p>More briefly:</p>
<p>22.65 g/cc Os (US$13000/kg), 19.3 g/cc W (US$30/kg), 15.6 g/cc WC
($???), 11.34 g/cc Pb (95c/kg), 7.9 g/cc Fe (21c/kg), 5.2 g/cc Fe3O4
(10c/kg), 2.6 g/cc SiO2 (3c/kg)</p>
<p>I feel like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_carbide">WC is probably cheaper than W, because Wikipedia
says</a> you can make it by heating WO₃ to 900° with graphite, and
the USGS’s Mineral Commodity Summaries put WO₃ prices at US$148–US$270
<em>per tonne</em> for the last several years.</p>
<p>Mercury, litharge, minium, and cinnabar should
probably be on the curve, too.</p>
<p>Not making the curve but still pretty cool, in part because of their
colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baryte: 46¢/kg, 4.48 g/cc</li>
<li>Zinc oxide: US$29/kg, 5.6 g/cc</li>
<li>Cupric oxide: US$3.90/kg, 6.315 g/cc</li>
<li>Manganese dioxide: 5.026 g/cc</li>
</ul>
<p>I visited the recycler and bought a kg of copper wire from him, which
cost AR$1200 (US$6.70/kg).  He explained that lead-acid battery lead
“is a different alloy” which is a reason for the higher price, also
indicating the plastic case as another reason, but I think he sort of
has those both backwards.  Still, as a heavy filler, scrap lead with
other impurities is probably close to the same density as pure battery
lead.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/pricing.html">Pricing</a> (35 notes)
