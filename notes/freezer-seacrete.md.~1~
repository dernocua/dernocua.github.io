I was thinking that maybe you could get better Faraday efficiency for
depositing seacrete by using a feedstock solution more concentrated
than seawater.

(WP gives chalk’s solubility as .013 g/ℓ, or
1.3 mg/100mℓ, so that’s about how dilute the solution would need to
be.  Also, that’s about how dilute it would need to be for
electrolytic mineral accretion; WP says bicarbonate ions are 0.14% of
all dissolved ions in seawater, which is 3.5% dissolved ions.
Magnesium hydroxide, brucite, Mohs 2.5–3, might be a more practical
primary electrolytic mineral accretion material, though maybe enough
dissolved CO₂ could tip the balance.)
