(1 minute)</div><p>Freehand plasma or oxy-acetylene cutting frequently wanders pretty far
offcourse, but plasma cutting along a straightedge is a lot more
precise.  If you want a complicated shape cut out of metal sheet,
rather than a straight line, you can cut out some kind of pattern
instead of using a straightedge.  For plasma cutting you may be able
to use laser-cut MDF, but oxy probably needs something that can resist
the heat.</p>
<p>Dried mud is quite possibly an adequate material for this, but if not,
surely fired-clay ceramic is.  You can roll the wet clay body into a
plastic sheet, let it dry to leather-hardness to get most of the
shrink out, then cut out the desired form with a knife or perhaps a
wire.  Alternatively, a sheet of gypsum can be either cut to shape or
deposited as paste.</p>
<p>How do you know where to cut?  You might be able to use a knife
plotter like those used to cut vinyl, but a probably-lower-budget
alternative is to project the shape to cut onto the surface with a
laser, then cut by hand.  For small projects, you can print out a plan
on a laser or, better, inkjet printer, and glue it onto the pattern
before hand-cutting.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/digital-fabrication.html">Digital fabrication</a> (31 notes)
