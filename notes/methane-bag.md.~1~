As explained in file `material-observations.md`, I filled a small
plastic shopping bag with methane, but to my disappointment it did not
rise into the air.  Calculations suggest that methane has
(12+4)/(.79×2×14+.21×2×16) ≈ 55% of the density of air, so should
provide some 500 mg/ℓ of lift.  I didn’t weigh this bag beforehand or
measure its volume, but it surely only contained a liter or two of
air.  Average plastic shopping bags weigh about 5 g, but lightweight
ones weigh as little as 100 mg.  None of the ones I have here weigh
less than 800 mg; a household garbage bag (550 mm × 480 mm) weighs
10.9 g, and another bag nearly as big (470 mm × 460 mm) only weighs
4.5 g.  A 1.1 g pharmacy bag (170 mm × 240 mm) weighed 1.1 g.  Several
bags of intermediate size weigh around 3 g.

If we approximate the volume of the 4.5-g bag as a 470-mm-long
cylinder wih 460-mm half-circumference, it would hold almost 32 ℓ,
enough to lift about 16 g, so it should definitely fly, but only by a
factor of about 3.  (And so should the garbage bag.)  If we scaled it
down by a factor of 3 to a 160-mm-long cylinder with 150-mm
half-circumference and 500 mg of mass, it would only hold 1.1 ℓ and
thus be just on the edge of buoyancy.  Most of my bags seem to be a
lot thicker than that, so they’ll only fly if they hold several
liters.

4.5 g over twice 470 mm × 460 mm is 10.4 g/m², so if the plastic is
close to 1 g/cc (it is — it’s high-density polyethylene, not lead or
something) it’s about 10 μm thick, same as the aluminum foil we get
here.  So this is probably about as good as it gets without going to
gold leaf or exotic composites.  Note that this suggests that ordinary
balloons (and bladder and intestine tissue) stretch even thinner than
this.

Lifting this body into the air would require 115 kg of lift, a sphere
of 2.8 m radius if filled with vacuum, or with methane (45% of the
lift of vacuum) 3.7 m, or 170 m² of surface area.  Hydrogen would
probably be a less dangerous lifting gas for humans suspended below
it, with more tendency to rise upwards when there’s a rupture and less
tendency to radiate heat downwards if it catches on fire.  There’s
still the problem of how to stop falling before the ground, though.

Unfortunately Mina doesn’t want me to fill a bag with 32 liters of
inflammable gas in the kitchen, which I have to say is an entirely
reasonable preference.
