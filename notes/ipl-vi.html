(4 minutes)</div><p>Reading <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/rand/ipl/P-1277_A_Command_Structure_For_Complex_Information_Processing_Aug58.pdf" title="Shaw, Newell, Simon, and Ellis">“A Command Structure for Complex Information Processing” from
01958</a>, and it’s pretty astonishing.</p>
<p>It talks about a memory made of dotted pairs in the same year as LISP,
and a CPU without arithmetic decades before Steele’s Scheme chip.</p>
<p>They hadn’t invented garbage collection yet, so they tried to use a
“responsibility bit” to distinguish the “owning” pointer to a
substructure, with the intent of giving their system a purely
hierarchical structure like a hard-link-free Unix filesystem.  They
didn’t know about symlinks, though, and they only associated this bit
with <code>car</code>, not <code>cdr</code> (pp. 17–18 (19–20/54)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single bit, <em>e</em>, is an essential piece of auxiliary information.
The address, <em>d</em>, in a symbol [“symbol” here means what LISP calls
<code>car</code>] may be the address of another list structure.  The
responsibility code in a symbol occurrence [<code>car</code>] indicates whether
this occurrence is “responsible” for the structure designated by
<em>d</em>.  If the same address, <em>d</em>, occurs in more than one word, only
one of these will indicate responsibility for <em>d</em>. ...The need for a
definite assignment of responsibility can be seen by considering the
process of erasing a list. ...although a system that will handle
merging lists also requires a responsibility bit on the link [<code>cdr</code>]
<em>f</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their design is a two-stack machine significantly before Forth; the
operand stack is “L<sub>0</sub>, <em>Communication List</em>” and the return
stack is “L<sub>2</sub>, <em>List of Current Instruction Addresses
(CIA)</em>” (p. 14).</p>
<p>They had the idea of a generator coroutine or OO or thunking or lazy
evaluation or duck typing too.  p. 7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without breakout devices [this is difficult to gloss], this format
would ... permit the operand [argument] of a process [subroutine] to
be specified only by giving its address.  ...these limitations are
removed... by allowing the address for an operand to refer either to
the operand itself or to any process that will determine the
operand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this was <em>before</em> thunking was invented for ALGOL-60 call by
name!  On p. 8 we see duck typing, coroutines, and laziness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Identity of Data with Programs</em></p>
<p>In current computers, the data are considered “inert.”  They are
symbols to be operated upon by the program.  All “structure” of the
data is ... encoded implicitly into the programs that work with the
data.  The structure is embodied in the conventions that determine
what bits the processes will decode, and so on.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to make the data “active.”  All words in
the computer will have the instruction format; there will be “data”
programs, and the data will be obtained by executing these
programs. ... a list of data, for example, may be specified by a
list of processes that determine the data.  Since data are only
desired “on command” by the processing programs, this approach leads
to a computer that, although still serial in its control, contains
at any given moment a large number of parallel active programs,
frozen in the midst of operation and waiting until called upon to
produce the next operation or piece of data.  This identity of data
with program can be attained only if the processing programs require
for their operation no information about the structure of the data
programs — only information about how to receive the data from them.</p>
