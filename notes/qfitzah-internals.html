(2 minutes)</div><p>Qfitzah represents terms as cons lists in the conventional Lisp way,
exploiting the isomorphism between ordered trees and binary trees.  A
term may be a constant, a variable, or a list; a list is represented
as a pair of the first item in the list, which may be any term, and
the rest of the list, which is either a pair or nil.  Additionally,
variables and constants are symbols.  I’m planning to add a new kind
of constant that is an unboxed small integer and not a symbol.</p>
<p>Each of the values in a pair is represented by a 32-bit word, and the
pair is represented by two adjacent 32-bit words in memory; its three
low-order bits represent the type tag of the object pointed to.  A
pair is represented by a pointer to the beginning of that pair, and
its low-order bits are ?00, 000 I think.</p>
<p>Variables (represented in the concrete syntax as symbols beginning
with an uncapitalized letter or their ilk) are represented by words
whose low-order bits are 010, and constants are represented by words
whose low-order bits are 001.  I’m planning to make numerical
constants be represented by words whose low-order bits are 101.  Nil
is represented by -1, so its low-order bits are 111, so if you were
expecting a term and got nil, it would look like both a variable and a
constant.  XXX this is a bug!  There are bugs where empty lists are
concerned.  Shit.  They match things they shouldn’t, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./qfitzah
↪ () (W)
↪ (F)
Violación de segmento (`core’ generado)
</code></pre>
<p>If you mask off the two low-order bits of the word that represents a
symbol, you get the address of a 32-bit word containing a pointer to
the characters of the symbol’s name; the following 32-bit word is the
length of the symbol’s name.  These records are allocated sequentially
in the atom table, which is initially filled with zeroes.</p>
<p>My thought is that if you shift an unboxed integer by 3 bits you get
the integer value.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/term-rewriting.html">Term rewriting</a> (3 notes)
