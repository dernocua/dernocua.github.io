Some notes on some things I tried.

Having melted the aluminum parts of the previous butane-torch nozzle
for 227-gram cans of butane, I bought a somewhat more robust one from
the hardware store for US$6, with no evident aluminum or plastic parts
and no striker.  This can produce a substantially more exciting flame.

Bought some 700 g borax from the hardware store for some US$2.  Smells
slightly acidic, suggesting it’s maybe contaminated with boric acid.
It successfully cross-links PVA glue (“plasticola”) into an insoluble
mass.  A hot wire causes it to adhere readily; application of heat
causes it to foam up quite a bit, suggesting that it’s quite hydrated,
and then collapse down into a glassy layer of, presumably, mostly
boria, which seems to be able to mostly dissolve construction sand
when reheated.  This suggests that it really is borax.

Heating the borax on low heat on the stove on some aluminum foil
produces a prodigious amount of white solid foam, similar to the
intumescent foam from sodium silicate (see file `glass-foam.md`),
which can be cut with a hot wire.  A drop of water on this foam has no
immediately obvious effect, but after a few minutes, has dissolved a
hole some 30 mm in diameter.

The internal bulb in one of these halogen household bulbs can be
heated to an orange heat in the butane torch without any softening,
and even quenching in water does not crack them.  This strongly
suggests that it really is quartz.  Too bad it’s burned out.  These
bulbs are hard to find nowadays, though some vendors have some
remaining stock for under US$1 each, and 150W–500W exterior halogen
floodlights still cost only US$2–US$4.

The replacement headlight bulb I got from an auto parts store (US$3)
has the same behavior, except that I haven’t tried quenching it,
suggesting that it’s also a quartz-halogen bulb.  (Also, the box
carries a pictorial warning against touching the glass.)  This is a
Magneti Marelli “H7 12V 55W PX26d”.  Cold (10°?) it measures some 7Ω
on a shitty multimeter that measures 3Ω short-circuit, demonstrating
why household 240V quartz-halogen bulbs would be better for use as
RTDs.  When reheated to orange-hot, it measures 2Ω but the meter's
short-circuit resistance has dropped to 1Ω, demonstrating that the
meter is totally inadequate for this purpose.  For heating-element
purposes such a bulb ought to be adequate up to nearly 1000°.

I bought 10 liters of off-white pumice from the garden store for US$2.
It’s so porous that it floats, but it’s open-cell enough that
sometimes it becomes waterlogged and sinks after a few seconds.  It
seems to weigh about 3.5 kg.  Stone dimensions are on the order of
10–40 mm.  It can be heated to orange heat in the blowtorch without
apparent change.  A hacksaw cuts it almost as easily as wood; a steel
wire can bore a hole through it far more easily than through wood, and
without cracking it in half.  It can be easily sanded on granite or on
other pumice stones, yielding a fine floury dust.

Though there is significant variation, it’s too hard to crush between
my fingers, break with my fingers, or carve with thumbnails in its
default form, though you can drill through it with a bamboo chopstick
and enough effort.  However, heating it to orange heat in the
blowtorch renders it somewhat more fragile (presumably by thermal
shock inducing microfractures), so that it can be broken by hand,
though still not crushed between my fingers.  Simply soaking it in
water does not have such a weakening effect, but quenching it in water
after such heating weakens the stone to an even greater degree.

One stone weighs 6.7 g.  When added to 151.3 g of tap water (including
yogurt cup), the reading was 158.1, a reading of 6.8 g.  Later the
reading was 157.9, and upon depressing it below the surface of the
water with wires, 159.1, suggesting 1.2 cc of volume out of the water,
or some 7.9 cc of total volume.  Upon removing the wet stone from the
water, the reading dropped from 158.0 to 150.2, a difference of 7.8 g,
and the wet stone weighed 7.7 g, suggesting there was 1.05 g of water
in its pore volume.  This suggests a total volume, including pore
volume around 9.0 cc and thus a dry density of 0.74 g/cc.

I stopped by a grow shop and was disappointed to find very little in
the way of pure fertilizers and pesticides, less even than in the
local garden store.

The garden-store green vitriol looks quite pure, though clumping
together like a gorgeous green deliquescent thing, but the solution in
tap water is a bit cloudy.  Adding an excess of baking soda produces,
after a while, voluminous green-brown bubbles that grow quite large
and do not pop, overflowing my inadequate yogurt cup.  A gray-green
gritty slime with a smell like metal precipitates; this is probably a
mix of carbonates and hydroxides of iron.  Effervescence continues for
an hour or more; probably boiling the soda first would have avoided
it.  Adding diammonium phosphate fertilizer instead in solid form
produces no visible reaction at first, but upon heating produces a
milky white precipitate, which later proceeds to form convection cells
like those in miso soup.
