(16 minutes)</div><p>As <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/welcome.html">R.J. Rummel has exhaustively documented</a> (<a href="https://thehilairebellocblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/an-invitation-to-modern-traveller-1898.html">blog</a>), liberal
democracy has substantially reduced the frequency of warfare, the
fatality of wars that do occur, and the frequency and fatality of
domestic mass killings such as genocides, which he terms “democides”.
And it seems to do this without damaging other desirable goals, such
as healthcare access, technological progress, social justice, and
material prosperity, at least compared to the other forms of
government we’ve been able to observe in practice so far.  Indeed,
there are plausible arguments that liberal democracy is the best
existing system at providing these other goods, though of course many
socialists disagree, and there are clear failures, like the material
prosperity of India and healthcare access in the US.</p>
<p>(Unlike Rummel, I think the US genocide of its Native American
population, the US's current system of mass incarceration, and the
<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61521/61521-h/61521-h.htm">mass murder in the French Congo</a> demonstrate that democracy, even
liberal democracy, is not a complete solution to the mass murder
problem, just a palliative, solving most of it.)</p>
<h2>When liberal democracy is unstable</h2>
<p>So, if or when we can’t abolish government entirely, liberal democracy
is vastly preferable to the other forms of government we have so far
been subjected to.  But human affairs are not inevitably guided toward
what is most preferable, and the relative stability of liberal
democracy is contingent on two historical facts which may not obtain.</p>
<p>First, it can only survive where liberalism is popular.  Where
liberalism is unpopular, you can have liberal undemocratic rule (as in
Singapore) or authoritarian democracy (as in Indira Gandhi’s India),
but the advent of democracy will extinguish whatever liberalism
exists, and quite possibly democracy as well.  Morsi’s Egypt and
post-Revolutionary Iran are examples of this: given the opportunity to
vote, the people voted in authoritarian leaders on the strength of
promises to crush freedoms; the soundbite version of the history is,
“One person, one vote, one time.”  In the US, the same thing could
plausibly happen with Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Kamala Harris, or
Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, none of whom favor liberalism.</p>
<p>Second, liberal or not, democracy is unstable where small elite armies
can defeat large popular armies.  States are institutionalized
violence, so a more effective manifestation of institutionalized
violence can overthrow any particular state.  This can manifest
externally, as conquest through invasion, or internally, as a military
coup.  Historically we can see that, in times and places when victory
in warfare was mostly determined by numbers of soldiers, some form of
republicanism puts the population under arms, and democracy is stable
if it is popular — Classical Greece with its spears and the 20th
century with its assault rifles, for example.  But, in times and
places where a military elite of well-equipped warriors can defeat a
much larger group of volunteers, frequently aristocracy or colonialism
is established, and the worst abuses follow — for example, late
19th-century and early 20th-century colonialism, the post-Columbian
Spanish conquests, and medieval European feudalism.</p>
<p>We can explain this by putting ourselves in the position of a
proponent of a late-20th-century warrior faction which has just lost a
democratic election, involving (as they always do) values you consider
to be sacred, which are now destined to be trampled under the feet of
the new government.  Overturning the results of the election by
violence in order to uphold those sacred values involves great
personal risk (you will likely die) and, because the voters for the
other side are more numerous, it probably will not succeed; they will
probably beat you on the battlefield just as they did at the polls.
In most cases your best option is to suffer the indignities of enemy
rule and hope for a better showing in the next election.</p>
<h2>A brief history of politics and warfare outside Asia</h2>
<p>By contrast, consider the position of a member of the British colonial
administration in the 01890s, faced with the knowledge that your
policies are unpopular (“with the natives”, they might say.)  <a href="https://thehilairebellocblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/an-invitation-to-modern-traveller-1898.html">As
Hilaire Belloc wrote satirically in 01898 in <em>The Modern
Traveller</em></a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61521/61521-h/61521-h.htm">p. 41</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never shall forget the way<br />
That [Captain] Blood upon this awful day<br />
Preserved us all from death.<br />
He stood upon a little mound,<br />
Cast his lethargic eyes around,<br />
And said beneath his breath:<br />
“Whatever happens we have got<br />
The Maxim Gun, and they have not.”<br />
He marked them in their rude advance,<br />
He hushed their rebel cheers;<br />
With one extremely vulgar glance<br />
He broke the Mutineers.<br />
(I have a picture in my book<br />
Of how he quelled them with a look.)<br />
We shot and hanged a few, and then<br />
The rest became devoted men.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belloc is writing about a caravan, but the same principle applies to
the violent subjugation of whole countries.  (The book’s illustration
of the “look” shows an angry white man with his arms crossed standing
next to a wheeled machine-gun; Belloc’s satire extended to skewering
the viciousness of his countrymen, but he only barely ridicules the
racism which made it so fatal, a racism he seems to have
wholeheartedly embraced.)</p>
<p>If you have the Maxim Gun and your political opponents are Zulus armed
with spears (or, as in Belloc’s scathingly cynical verse, natives of
Liberia, perhaps Mande or Kru), what incentive do you have to permit
them a vote, knowing that they may vote to confiscate your property,
disestablish Anglicanism, persecute Christians and the Khoi-San
(perhaps merely by refusing recognition to their marriages, or perhaps
in more severe ways), lay heavy tariffs on your exports, slash the
military budget that pays your salary, and purge the universities of
professors who oppose their cause?  They may not do all of these
things, of course, if they are committed to liberalism; but any
political faction that accedes to democracy is implicitly acceding to
the possibility of being governed by their enemies, who may treat them
very badly indeed.</p>
<p>Of course, what the British colonial powers did with this unlimited
power throughout Africa was to abuse it thoroughly, even if to a
smaller extreme than the Congolese colonies; the African-American
colonists of Liberia did the same to the Liberian natives, for that
matter.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, so no
government is free of corruption, and unassailable governments are
enormously corrupt.</p>
<p>Quoting Belloc is of course epistemological malpractice: we cannot
deduce anything about what really happened from his intentional
fiction.  But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun#Use_in_colonial_warfare_%281886%E2%80%931914%29">as Wikipedia says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Maxim gun was first used extensively in an African conflict
during the First Matabele War in Rhodesia. During the Battle of the
Shangani, 700 soldiers fought off 5,000 Matabele warriors with just
five Maxim guns. It played an important role in the "Scramble for
Africa" in the late 19th century. The extreme lethality was employed
to devastating effect against obsolete charging tactics, when
African opponents could be lured into pitched battles in open
terrain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the open-field battles we know about in the Bronze Age were
carried out between chariot-mounted archers, whose horses could easily
outrun unarmored massed infantry, dodging their arrows, while the
archer picked off the immobile soldiers one by one.  Building chariots
and maintaining teams of horses involved major expenses beyond what
average citizens could muster; consequently they belonged to palaces
whose rulers could tax many subjects, and there were no citizens.
Iron Age warfare, by contrast, was dominated by mass formations like
the phalanx, and maneuvers of infantry like the Greek hoplites,
following the “hoplite revolution” around 00700 BCE.  This is the era
during which (illiberal) democracy flourished in Athens and many other
Greek city-states, despite frequent interruptions and setbacks, and
(illiberal) republicanism would rule Rome for centuries before the
Empire; Livy and Plutarch trace this development to Greek influence.
Rousseau argued that it was the “professionalization” of the Roman
legions (previously a conscript force) that ended the Republic; he may
have been right.</p>
<p>The European Middle Ages were dominated by a knightly class whose
power over the serfs was nearly absolute; various “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czech_civilian_firearms_possession">communes</a>”
governed by the common people arose from time to time but, except for
Switzerland and some Italian republics, were overthrown within a
century or three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithmarschen#Post-Medieval_History">by ambitious kings and knights</a>, notably the
Habsburgs.  This was possible because the technological basis of
warfare at the time enabled a few well-trained warriors with horses
and armor to defeat a much larger number of peasants, so democracy,
liberal or not, could not withstand contact with warriors — whether
external or internal.</p>
<p>Guns, especially smoothbore guns like the arquebus and musket, require
much less training to use effectively, enabling large groups of
peasants to defeat capital-intensive, highly-trained knights, for
example in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Czech_civilian_firearms_possession">Hussite revolt in 01419</a>.  In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_warfare">Early Modern
Period</a>, gunpowder thus gave the military advantage to whichever
faction was more popular, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism#Renaissance_republicanism">Renaissance republicanism</a> took
form, with Machiavelli strongly advocating universal conscription.
The French National Assembly put Machiavelli’s advice into practice
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_en_masse"><em>levée en masse</em></a>, allowing Napoleon to defeat the
better-trained Prussian army (accustomed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_wars">cabinet wars</a> that
started in 01648) by outnumbering them ten to one — and of course the
result of this new form of power was bloodthirsty conquest.</p>
<p>This military dynamic was disrupted by the late-19th-century emergence
of the crew-served machine-gun, exemplified by the Maxim type
mentioned above, then to some extent restored by the emergence of
Kalashnikov’s AK-47.  Peasant forces armed with AK-47s and similar
weapons were able to resist invasions by vastly better equipped armies
in some cases in the 20th and early 21st century, notably the US’s
defeat in Vietnam, the USSR’s defeat in Afghanistan, and the US’s
defeat in Afghanistan in 02021 after 20 years of fighting.</p>
<h2>Where do we stand today, and where are we going?</h2>
<p>Still, it’s hard to credit that a military élite would be unable to
defeat a much larger untrained force in a world full of nuclear
weapons, aircraft carriers, near-universal gun control laws (extending
even to knives in a few cases, such as the UK since 01953), fighter
jets, and pervasive surveillance.  Nowadays surveillance enlists
cellphone networks, social networking sites, license-plate cameras,
RFID toll-road payment schemes, DNA databases, credit cards, and
sometimes more extreme measures; to assassinate Osama bin Laden, the
US subverted a vaccination program to scan DNA, and in putting down
the rebellion in occupied Iraq in 02007, the US used high-resolution
telescopes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARGUS-IS">ARGUS-IS</a> to record all public movement in an
area, so as to be able to trace back roadside bombs to the houses of
rebels after they exploded.</p>
<p>The US’s moderately successful invasion of Iraq in 01991 demonstrated
the effectiveness of precision-guided munitions, which have been
pivotal weapons in every war since then; in <a href="https://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2014/10/putin-to-western-elites-play-time-is.html">02014, Putin gave a
speech at Sochi</a> (<a href="https://cluborlov.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/putin-to-western-elites-play-time-is-over/">new location</a>), saying they were as
important as nuclear weapons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many states do not see any other ways of ensuring their sovereignty
but to obtain their own bombs. This is extremely dangerous. We
insist on continuing talks; we are not only in favor of talks, but
insist on continuing talks to reduce nuclear arsenals. The less
nuclear weapons we have in the world, the better. And we are ready
for the most serious, concrete discussions on nuclear disarmament –
but only serious discussions without any double standards.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Today, many types of high-precision weaponry are
already close to mass-destruction weapons in terms of their
capabilities, and in the event of full renunciation of nuclear
weapons or radical reduction of nuclear potential, nations that are
leaders in creating and producing high-precision systems will have a
clear military advantage. Strategic parity will be disrupted, and
this is likely to bring destabilization. The use of a so-called
first global pre-emptive strike may become tempting. In short, the
risks do not decrease, but intensify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Precision-guided munitions can be immensely more efficient than
conventional munitions; bombing Dresden into a firestorm took 7100
tonnes of bombs, and the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima weighed
4.4 tonnes, but it only takes 100 milligrams of explosives, 200
nanograms of botox, 50 nanograms of polonium, or 100 millimeters of
knife blade to kill a general or president on the opposing side,
or — perhaps more effectively — his son or daughter, if he doesn’t
cooperate.  There are two tricky parts to this sort of assassination:
knowing where the target is, and delivering the weapon to the target.
A precision-guided munition solves the second part of the problem, but
presently the first part remains the province of centralized spy
agencies like the КГБ where Putin grew up.</p>
<p>The wide availability of PGMs, then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060111213058/http://jef.raskincenter.org/unpublished/next_time_can_be_worse.html">which Raskin argued in 02001 was
inevitable</a>, would seem to deliver a strong military advantage to
whichever group is best at spying on the weak points of its
rivals — and concealing their own.  The organizations that will be
best at this will probably be criminal gangs like Mexico’s Zetas.</p>
<p>There is of course no guarantee that such conditions will permit the
continuance of civilization, much less democracy; civilization has
collapsed on many occasions in the past (around the Mediterranean in
the Bronze Age Collapse, in the Maya collapse, in Egypt under the
Christian onslaught in the 5th century, in the collapse of the
Anasazi, to a lesser extent the post-USSR age, and so on) and it may
do so again.  Technological conditions that permit small military
élites to militarily defeat much larger popular movements may doom
democracy, since it deprives those élites of reasons to accede to
electoral defeat; conditions that make attacking easy and defending
impossible would seem to doom civilization entirely.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack">In March we saw ransomware shut down the main oil pipeline on the
East Coast of the US</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services#Significant_service_outages">on December 7</a> there were major
outages of much of the World-Wide Web when the biggest data center of
Amazon Web Services went down; many customers were revealed to have no
disaster plan.  There is no evidence that this incident was due to any
kind of hostile action, just that AWS is a central point of
vulnerability a malicious actor could attack, possibly commanding a
high ransom.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/history.html">History</a> (24 notes)
