(17 minutes)</div><p>Talc (Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂) is very interesting, particularly for cyclic
fabrication systems, because it <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/15/jresv15n5p551_A1b.pdf">calcines to enstatite and amorphous
silica</a> at 800–840°, and the enstatite (MgSiO₃) converts to
clinoenstatite at 1200° (?), and the amorphous silica to cristobalite
at 1300° <a href="https://www.eurotalc.eu/what-talc">(or possibly it converts to enstatite above 1050°?)</a>;
enstatite <a href="http://deanpresnall.org/files/90Enst.melting.pdf">melts at some 1550°</a> and quartz/cristobalite at 1713°.
You could think of enstatite as being a quartz/forsterite eutectic,
and indeed 1543° <a href="http://www.geo.umass.edu/courses/geo321/Lecture%208%20Binary%20Systems.pdf">is the lowest-melting point in the quartz/forsterite
continuum</a>, but the cristobalite crystals remain solid until
1713°.  (I’m not sure how solid the resulting slush is, though...)</p>
<h2>Potential for inorganic cyclic fabrication systems</h2>
<p>If you have an ample supply of talc, then, as with clay, you can shape
it into the geometry you want, and then fire it to harden it.  As with
clay, you can use tools thus made to shape new objects.  However,
firing talc to harden it does not (?) cause it to become plastic and
change in shape or shrink; the results are nonporous and extremely
unreactive; and they are capable of withstanding much higher
temperatures than those needed to fire them, so it should be easy to
make talc-firing ovens out of fired talc.  The required firing
temperature is lower than for most clays, and much lower than for
high-performance porcelain clays.</p>
<p>Because the unfired talc is not plastic and does not become plastic
during firing, very large shapes can be precisely cut and fired in a
gravitational field without suffering plastic deformation.  Though
brittle, the fired objects are highly resistant to thermal shock, in
part because of their low thermal coefficient of expansion
(<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.537.1305&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" title="Thermal expansion of natural orthoenstatite to 1473 K, Eur. J. Mineral. 2003, 15, 469­473, Jackson et al.">enstatite’s linear TCE is a steel-like 11 ppm/K</a>), permitting
their use for a wide variety of applications with demanding
temperature gradient requirements.</p>
<p>Talc is a <a href="https://www.scientific.net/AMR.105-106.802" title="Synthesis of Cordierite with Low Thermal Expansion Coefficient">useful feedstock for synthesizing cordierite</a>, a
common refractory with an acicular crystal habit and even lower TCE,
which can be as low as 0.8 ppm/K for porous cordierite materials.</p>
<p>For machinery involving sliding contact, unfired talc serves as a dry
lubricant.</p>
<p>Obtaining adequate supplies of natural talc may be difficult, but
straightforward hydrothermal talc synthesis processes are known, and
some of them can be carried out in vessels made of fired talc.  The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth's_crust">raw feedstocks are abundant</a>: oxygen is 47% of the Earth’s
crust, silicon 28%, and magnesium 2.1%.  Only hydrogen is scarce
(0.14%), and it is removed in the firing process.</p>
<p>Fired talc is hard enough to grind or cut softer metals, but I think
it can only barely cut steel, if that.</p>
<p>Even fired, talc is not a very good material for withstanding impact,
controlling electricity, or spring energy storage.</p>
<h2>History of firing talc</h2>
<p><a href="https://nwssa.org/sculpture-northwest/the-stone-corner/111-stone-corner-firing-soapstone-marapr-2002" title=" Stone Corner - Firing Soapstone Mar/Apr 2002">An anonymous stone sculptor writes</a> that they have been firing
soapstone as a stone-sculpting technique for many years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many years ago I wrote an article about firing soapstone to make the
stone harder. It is possible to harden the stone to the point that
you cannot scratch it with anything short of steel. This will also
close the structure of the stone enough to allow it to be used in
outdoor applications. ... Insulators on the electric poles were at
one time made of fired soapstone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://geology.com/rocks/soapstone.shtml">A geology.com article says the Americans have been carving soapstone
for 8000 years</a>, although I’m not clear on whether the results
were fired — but because cooking bowls, cooking slabs, and smoking
pipes were among the uses, I suspect they were.  The same article
mentions the Scandinavian Bronze-Age use of soapstone for carving
bronze-casting molds.  (Also, it mentions that some “soapstone
carvings” are actually alabaster or serpentine.)</p>
<p>Reportedly <a href="https://digitalfire.com/article/understanding+the+deflocculation+process+in+slip+casting">potters use 50% talc, 50% ball clay</a> for slipcasting.</p>
<h2>Material qualities</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2019.04.084">“Synthesis of MgSiO₃ ceramics using natural desert sand as SiO2
source”</a> Wang et al. mention some pretty cool benefits of
enstatite-based ceramics, including protoenstatite’s “adjustable
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high strength, low dielectric
loss, and strong vibration resistance” at high temperatures, but
lament its tendency to crack when transforming to clinoenstatite at
lower temperatures.  Evidently this is not a problem with fired-talc
ceramics, though.</p>
<h2>Firing synthetic magnesium silicate</h2>
<p>Apparently if you react soluble magnesium and silicate salts, at low enough Mg/Si ratios
<a href="https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/empa/islandora/object/empa%3A7119/datastream/PDF2/download/Nied-2016-Properties_of_magnesium_silicate_hydrates_%28M-S-H%29-%28accepted_version%29.pdf" title="Nied, D., Enemark-Rasmussen, K., L’Hopital, E., Skibsted, J., &amp; Lothenbach, B. (2016). Properties of magnesium silicate hydrates (M-S-H). Cement and Concrete Research, 79, 323-332. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2015.10.003 CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0">you get crystalline talc</a>
but only above 200°.  But, according to the same paper, it looks like
amorphous synthetic magnesium silicate hydrates also produce silica
when fired in the same way, but at a slightly lower temperature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Differential thermal analysis (DTA) of the M-S-H samples reveals a
distinct exothermic transition around 840 - 860 °C, which is
attributed to the decomposition of amorphous M-S-H and the
recrystallization to SiO₂ and enstatite (MgSiO₃) [11, 12] or SiO₂
and forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) for high Mg/Si ratios [29]. The
dehydroxylation of the phyllosilicate sheets in talc
(Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂) and the transformation to SiO₂ and enstatite occurs
at slightly higher temperatures of 850 to 950 °C [11, 12]. The lower
dehydroxylation temperature of M-S-H compared to talc is consistent
with a less crystalline structure [11, 12].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It’s worth noting that their room-temperature synthesis took a year,
but only because they were using low-solubility feedstocks.)</p>
<p>And I’ve prepared what seems to be this amorphous material in my
kitchen by dumping magnesium chloride from the health food store into
a can of waterglass (see <a href="../notes/glass-foam.html">Glass foam</a> for details).  However,
it came out in the state of sort of slushy lumps; I’m not sure how to
stick it together into a more solid material.  Maybe with more
waterglass, I don’t know.</p>

“Functionalization of synthetic talc-like phyllosilicates by
alkoxyorganosilane grafting”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A range of talc-like phyllosilicates were prepared via a
hydrothermal synthesis performed at five different temperatures from
160 to 350 °C. The organization of the lattice and the degree of
crystallinity of the new materials were evaluated by different
techniques such as XRD, FTIR, solid-state 29Si NMR, TEM, FEG-SEM and
TG-DTA. When synthesized at low temperature the material presents
high degree of hydration, low crystallinity and flawed
structure. This was attributed to stevensite-talc interstratified
product present in the samples. The stevensite/talc ratio and the
hydration decrease in the talc-like phyllosilicate samples when the
hydrothermal synthesis temperature increases and so the
crystallinity becomes higher. A thermal treatment at 500 °C allowed
a significant flaw reduction in talc-like phyllosilicate structure;
the synthesized sample at 350 °C and heat treated presents a
structure close to that of talc.</p>

<p>Over the past 2 years, the synthetic process of talc particles has
evolved considerably, leading to an inexpensive, convenient, and
rapid process that is compatible with industrial requirements. In
addition to facilitate the synthetic talc preparation, the evolution
of the synthesis process has led to an improved crystallographic
arrangement of the talc particles in both the c* direction and (ab)
plane. In the present study, the most recent process was
investigated with respect to the reaction time, temperature,
pressure, pH, and salt concentration to determine the optimal
reaction parameters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In its raw state the softness of steatite make it extremely easily
damaged, and simply wearing or using a carved object would damage
the carved detail. Steatite has an interesting property, when it is
fired it will convert from steatite into enstatite. Unlike steatite,
enstatite has a hardness of Mohs 5.5 which is close to that of
granite – making it extremely hard wearing and resistant to damage,
whilst still retaining its carved detail. Steatite has also been
glazed since the Predynastic era for objects such as beads and
amulets. ... Firing at a temperature of ~950°C will cause steatite
to dehydrate and crystallise into enstatite. Clay will begin its
vitrification process ~800-900°C and firing will generally require
temperatures in excess of 1100°C , therefore the steatite to
enstatite conversion can be achieved using similar technology as is
required for firing clay objects. A wood fuelled open fire can
easily reach temperatures exceeding 1100°C, and can be used for
firing ceramics and also for converting steatite to enstatite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this study, in situ Raman spectroscopy, quenched scanning
electron microscopy, micro-X-ray diffraction, and thermodynamic
calculations were used to explore the interplay between dolomite and
silica-rich fluids at relatively low temperatures in fused silica
tubes. Results showed that talc formed at ≤200°C and low CO2 partial
pressures (PCO2). The reaction rate increased with increasing
temperature and decreased with increasing PCO2. The major
contributions of this study are as follows: we confirmed the
formation mechanism of Mg-carbonate-hosted talc deposits and proved
that talc can form at ≤200°C; the presence of talc in carbonate
reservoirs can indicate the activity of silica-rich hydrothermal
fluids; and (3) the reactivity and solubility of silica require
further consideration, when a fused silica tube is used as the
reactor in high P–T experiments.</p>

<p>Ceramic bodies (7.0 cm × 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm) of kaolinite clay and
soapstone residuals collected from workshops in Ouro Preto and
Mariana, Minas Gerais, Brazil, containing from 2.5 to 97.5 wt%
steatite (soapstone) were prepared and firing at 500, 1000 and 1200
°C, for 2 h, in air. The linear shrinkage, compressive strength,
water absorption and mass loss by heating were determined on the
samples after heat treatment. The fired samples at 1000 and 1200 °C,
with steatite percentages of 85, 90 and 95%, presented the best
results for technological applications in ceramic industry.  For
these samples, the values of the compressive strength were higher
than 10 MPa and those of water absorption varied between 8 and 22%,
which means that the values of these properties are superior and
inferior, respectively, to the reference values established by
Brazilian Standards. The linear shrinkage was lower than 6%, which
is the maximum value established by the Pólo Cerâmico de Santa
Gertrudes, in São Paulo State.</p>

“Talc-based cementitious products: Effect of talc calcination”
cc-by-nc-nd</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This study reports the use of calcined talc for cementitious
products making. The calcination is used to enhance the availability
of magnesium from talc to react with phosphate for cement phase
formation. It is shown that previous calcination of talc leads to
products having enhanced mechanical performance due to the formation
of more cement phase than in products based on raw talc. Talc fired
at 900 °C was found to be the one in which magnesium release was
maximal. Firing at temperature higher than 900 °C leads to the
stabilization of enstatite, which decreased the magnesium
availability. The cement phase is struvite, which was better
detected on the X-ray patterns of the products involving fired
talc. All the products have very rapid setting time and low
shrinkage.</p>
