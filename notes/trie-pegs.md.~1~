Reading some hackers talking about Packrat parsers, it occurred to me
that perhaps you could get a huge speedup in Packrat by a different
memoizing approach.

Normally in Packrat a parsing grammar node (or perhaps a nonterminal)
is invoked at a given position of a given stream and returns a result,
either a successful parse or a failure, which is memoized with the
(position, grammar node) pair as the memo table key.
