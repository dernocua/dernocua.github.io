This suggests that by this means we can fabricate composite materials
with high loadings of fibrous or especially laminar reinforcing filler
(e.g., talc, clays, carbon fibers, carborundum whiskers, graphene,
MXenes; see file `electrolytic-2d-cutting.md` for some fuller lists)
without having to assemble them layer by layer.  Specifically, you
bulk up the polymer with a lot of solvent, mix in your functional
filler, deposit it in an X–Y sheet of uniform thickness on some
substrate, evaporate off the solvent resulting in a great loss of
volume, and then break the sheet free from the substrate.

Adherence to the substrate prevents the sheet from shrinking in the
X–Y plane as it dries, forcing all of the volume loss to be in the Z
direction; this reorients the filler particles nearly parallel to the
X–Y plane, allowing them to pack much more tightly than laminar
reinforcing particles normally could, potentially resulting in a final
product that consists almost entirely of the filler, bound together
with a small amount of matrix.  If the solution is sufficiently
viscous or dense, or if surface charges maintain the filler particles
deflocculated, the filler will not settle out or float out before
being held in place during the drying process.  Thus the filler will
be evenly dispersed through the resulting matrix.

As I understand it, the drying process normally works by first gelling
the viscous solution into a hydrogel, then contracting it into a
xerogel under the influence of surface tension in the nanopores of the
gel.  Thus, carrying out the above process with metals using mercury
as a solvent may or may not work, because solid amalgams are not gels,
and the shrinking process may be different from xerogel collapse.  It
may work anyway, though; I think mercury can dissolve all of zinc,
copper, tin, lead, silver, and gold to an appreciable extent, and at
least in the case of gold it is commonplace to recover fully dense
solid gold by heating, which is how mercury gilding works.
