Electrochemical machining has reasonably high material removal rates,
no side loading or heat affected zone, and permits cutting fairly
free-form parts in 3-D, much like CNC milling.  But in its ordinary
form it can't cut parts with complex internal spaces, and in a pure
3-axis form it can't even cut overhangs.
