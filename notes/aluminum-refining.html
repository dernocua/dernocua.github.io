(3 minutes)</div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylsulfonylmethane">Methylsulfonylmethane</a>, a nontoxic useless dietary supplement the
FDA deems “generally recognized as safe”, melts at 109° and can
reportedly dissolve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_chloride">aluminum trichloride</a>, from which a new paper
reports that aluminum metal can be electrolytically deposited under an
anhydrous argon atmosphere in a glove box (I think the paper said at
140°).  (Aluminum trichloride alone reportedly sublimates at 182.7°,
so some kind of solvent is needed.)</p>
<p>Aluminum trichloride is itself relatively safe; <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Aluminum-chloride">PubChem says it’s in
antiperspirants at up to 15% concentration</a>, though it “may cause
severe irritation to eyes” and is “toxic by ingestion” (hexahydrate
LD₅₀: 3311 mg/kg rat (oral); anhydrous 380 mg/kg).  A tricky thing is
that it’s maybe best to consider the anhydrous form as a separate
compound from the hexahydrate — if you heat the hexahydrate
((Al(H₂O)₆)Cl₃)), it doesn’t dehydrate to the anhydrous form, but
rather releases muriatic acid and forms alumina at 100°!  The Merck
Index says, “Fumes in air, strong odor of HCl; when heated in small
quantities volatilizes without melting. Combines with water with
explosive violence and liberation of much heat.”</p>
<p>It’s normally produced from aluminum metal, as explained in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3343911A/en">US patent
3,343,911</a>, though <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3760066A/en">US patent 3,760,066 documents a process for
producing it from chlorine, carbon, and alumina at 800°–1000°</a>,
part of the patent office’s classification “C01F7/60 - Preparation of
anhydrous aluminium chloride from oxygen-containing aluminium
compounds”.</p>
<p>At the risk of making a fool of myself by trivializing a patent
classification with 16 patents in it (all expired: 01919, 01923,
01925, 01926, 01927, 01928, 01932, 01964, 01971, 01973, 01975, 01977,
01978, 01982, 01990, and 02004), this reaction seems like it would be
pretty straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>2 Al(OH)₃ + 6 HCl → (Al(H₂O)₆)Cl₃ + AlCl₃
</code></pre>
<p>That is, if you react dry aluminum hydroxide with anhydrous muriatic
acid, you should get a 1:1 molar ratio of the hexahydrate and the
anhydrous, which you then must separate.  Without using water!  Worse,
you probably don’t really have this neat separation of water-complexed
aluminum ions from non-complexed ones; I think you’ll get polymeric
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_chlorohydrate">aluminum chlorohydrate</a>.</p>
<p>But I bet that if you heat up the mixture to drive off the HCl you’ll
end up with a mix of anhydrous aluminum chloride and alumina, and I
bet the alumina is insoluble in methylsulfonylmethane.</p>
<p>This is particularly interesting because purified Al(OH)₃ is the
result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process">Bayer process</a> by which aluminum is electrowon
today — but by dissolving alumina in cryolite, rather than aluminum
chloride in methylsulfonylmethane.  Crudely we should expect this
process to be cheaper because it runs at such a low temperature.
Could this be a new economic route to aluminum refining?</p>
<p>It would be even more exciting if it turned out to be possible to do
the same trick with, for example, magnesium chlorate, magnesium
formate, magnesium perchlorate, or titanium tetrachloride.</p>
