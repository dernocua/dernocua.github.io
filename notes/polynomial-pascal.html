(4 minutes)</div><p>The number of coefficients of a general polynomial of a given degree
in a given number of independent variables is a binomial coefficient,
<em>n</em>C<em>m</em>.  This is surely well known, but it was surprising to me.</p>
<p>The general quadratic polynomial in two variables is <em>ax</em>² + <em>bxy</em> +
<em>cy</em>² + <em>dx</em> + <em>ey</em> + <em>f</em>; it has six coefficients.  Each of its terms
has degree 2 <em>or less</em>.</p>
<p>(By introducing a third variable <em>z</em>=1 we can make them each have
degree 2 <em>exactly</em>: <em>ax</em>² + <em>bxy</em> + <em>cy</em>² + <em>dxz</em> + <em>eyz</em> + <em>fz</em>².  So
6, the number of coefficients, is also the number of ways to get 2 by
adding up three natural numbers (including 0): 2+0+0, 1+1+0, 0+2+0,
1+0+1, 0+1+1, 0+0+2.)</p>
<p>In one variable, the number is 3: <em>ax</em>² + <em>bx</em> + <em>c</em>.  In general, in
one variable, the number of coefficients for degree <em>d</em> is <em>d</em>+1.</p>
<p>In no variables or in degree 0 for any number of variables, the number
is 1: <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>One way to factor <em>ax</em>² + <em>bxy</em> + <em>cy</em>² + <em>dx</em> + <em>ey</em> + <em>f</em> is as a
quadratic in <em>x</em>, <em>ax</em>² + <em>dx</em> + <em>f</em>, plus <em>y</em> times a linear in <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>(<em>bx</em>
+ <em>e</em>), plus <em>y</em>² times a constant in <em>x</em>, <em>cy</em>².  In matrix form:</p>
<pre><code>[ f   e  c ] [ y⁰ ]
[ dx bx  0 ] [ y¹ ]
[ ax² 0  0 ] [ y² ]
</code></pre>
<p>So it seems like the number of coefficients in a two-variable
polynomial will be a triangular number; to extend this to cubics, for
example, we’d add a new leftmost column that’s a general cubic in <em>x</em>,
some zeroes to fill out the bottom row, and <em>y</em>³ to the bottom of the
vector.</p>
<p>This is a general property: the general degree-<em>d</em> polynomial in <em>n</em>
variables is a sum of the general polynomials of all degrees up to and
including <em>d</em> in <em>n</em>-1 variables, each multiplied by the appropriate
power of the newly introduced variable to bring it up to the correct
degree.</p>
<p>If we instead try the same trick to go to a quadratic in three
independent variables, introducing, say, <em>w</em>, we can take this general
two-variable quadratic and multiply it by <em>w</em>⁰, take a general
two-variable linear polynomial (3 coefficients) and multiply it by
<em>w</em>¹, take a general two-variable constant polynomial (1 coefficient)
and multiply it by <em>w</em>².  So we have 1 + 3 + 6 = 10, but not because
it’s the fourth triangular number; rather, because it’s the third
tetrahedral number.</p>
<p>Without formally proving it, it seems like this is a matter for
Pascal’s triangle of binomial coefficients, (<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)!/(<em>a</em>! <em>b</em>!):</p>

<p>The number of coefficients for polynomials in zero variables are in
the first column; for polynomials in one variable in the second
column; for polynomials in two variables in the third column; and so
on.</p>
<p>The fourth column says that in three variables, a degree-0 polynomial
has one coefficient; a degree-1 polynomial, 4; a degree-two
polynomial, as explained above, 10; and a degree-three polynomial, 20.</p>
<p>This also means that the number of coefficients in a polynomial in
three variables grows as O(<em>d</em>³); specifically, it's
(<em>d</em>+1)(<em>d</em>+2)(<em>d</em>+3)/6.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (11 notes)
