Because it’s the most common masculine singular nominative suffix,
Greek is full of nouns and adjectives that end in “-os” (“-ος”),
including many people’s names, although in many cases English got them
by way of Latin, which usually substituted its own masculine singular
nominative suffix, “-us”.  And there’s also an “-ιος” suffix (I think
that’s the singular genitive of the same declension?) which gives us
names like “Apollonios” and “Dionysios” and Hephaestus's epithet
“Aitnaios”.  Of course, to a programmer, the “-os” suffix sounds like
an operating system, like MacOS, AmigaOS, MS-DOS, RISC OS, iOS, IOS,
BeOS, GEOS, GECOS, SunOS, Unicos, ReactOS, FreeDOS, TempleOS, KeyKOS,
Palm OS, ChibiOS, and the like, and there is a long tradition of
naming computer systems after figures from Greek mythology, such as
Kerberos and Project Athena.

So multilingual puns seem to be called for.

This is not an entirely new idea; [CDC named an OS “Kronos”][0],
[there was an MS-DOS alternative called “THEOS”][1], of course EROS,
and there has probably been more than one OS called [Cosmos][10].

Adding to the potential for multilingual puns, masculine *plurals* of
nouns and adjectives in Spanish and Portuguese *also* commonly end in
“-os”, and “Unicos” and “AROS” are already Spanish (and Portuguese)
words, meaning “only” and “rings/earrings” respectively; [Liddell and
Scott additionally define ἄρος][2] as “use, profit, help”.  Too bad
it’s already taken!

But we could imagine, for example, the cult of HefaistOS AitnaiOS in
LemnOS, OdysseOS, DionysOS and his thiasOS and SeilenOS drinking from
a cantharOS, carrying a thyrsOS and suffering a sparagmOS,
hermaphroditOS, FalOS, OceanOS, TyrnavOS, PriapOS, GlaucOS, LycurgOS,
ScyrOS, KotylOS, [AscOS][3], AryballOS, CyprOS, TheofrastOS, DiodorOS
Siceliotes, HerodotOS, FlaviOS PorfyrogenitOS, HalicarnassOS, HomerOS,
ChiOS, ChaOS, EustachiOS, DemetriOS, ParnassOS, PeisistratOS, SamOS,
LogOS, StrategOS, [HyperbolOS][4], PeloponnesOS, [ArgOS][5]
[Panoptes][7], HeliOS, Hermes [TrismegistOS][7], AtreOS, PrometheOS,
Eos, OrpheOS, TartarOS, BriareOS, AnytOS, IapetOS, OlympOS,
ApollodorOS, OuranOS, KratOS, TheOS ProterOS, [FolOS][8], KentaurOS,

[AngelOS][12], TheseOS, [TyphOS or TyphoiOS][13], AischylOS,
[PatroclOS][14], [FaidrOS][15], [OrthOS][16] (which is “assholes” in
Spanish, though misspelled), [KadmOS][17],
