It occurred to me that a back-biased red or green LED or base-emitter
junction might make an interesting substitute for a spark gap in a
tiny Marx generator.  These often break down in avalanche mode with
minimal or no damage to the semiconductor, often at voltages under 10
volts.  So you could easily produce a pulse train at 100 volts or
more, perhaps from a 5-volt source using only tiny surface-mount
components.

The average achievable power of the device probably will not be large,
since especially base-emitter junctions are not optimized for power
dissipation, and, according to folklore, high-power LEDs generally do
not tolerate avalanche breakdown well.  Moreover, the properties the
device relies on here (avalanche energy tolerance, reverse breakdown
voltage) are not among the properties the manufacturer normally
specifies, except I guess on JFETs.  But JFETs are tiny high-precision
devices, so JFET gate junctions are probably even worse for this
application.

I suspect that, at least with silicon, you won’t get a good avalanche
effect until 7 volts or more; below that, the less abrupt Zener effect
will dominate.  Purpose-built “zener” avalanche diodes might also
work, but since they’re sold as voltage references, they might be
designed to spike as little as possible — the spikes we’re after here
are troublesome noise in voltage-reference applications.  At least
you’d have a well-characterized and optimized power rating.  And of
course diacs would definitely work and have been used in production
Marx generators in the past.  (Can you get MOS latchup out of power
MOSFETs?  Probably not.)

Looking at file `pick-and-place.md`, I see that 5% 1k resistors
occupying half an 0402-equivalent cost 0.385¢ soldered (and a few
other values are available); discrete 1% 0402s are 0.305¢ in a wide
variety of sizes; 0402 MLCCs are 0.4¢, while 1206 MLCCs are 1.3¢; NPN
S9013 transistors are 1.58¢ and MMBT3904 is 1.32¢; red 0805 LEDs are
1.54¢; zeners only come in 5.6V and 3.3V and cost 1.35¢; 5.8V TVSs
cost 2.91¢.  Each Marx stage requires an avalanche element, a cap, and
two resistors, so maybe an MMBT3904 (3 mm × 3 mm?), an 0402 cap (1 mm
× ½ mm), and two 0402 resistors, for a total of 2.33¢ and 10½ mm²,
probably 25 mm² in practice.

A particularly interesting question is how fast the device completes
its avalanche discharge and recovers (through recombination of the
freed-up charge carriers).  It wouldn’t surprise me to find a
transistor was capable of producing higher frequencies in this
avalanche-diode mode than when being used as a real transistor.  But
are we talking about potential pulse repetition rates of 10 kHz,
100 kHz, 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 1 GHz, 10 GHz?  How high do the
harmonics go?  I’m guessing that they’re much faster than a
corona-stabilized spark gap (≈20 kHz repetition rate) but I don’t know
how much.  Even high-voltage SCRs typically manage 10 kHz.

Possible applications:

- Pulsed power for operating LEDs at higher power without time for
  thermal runaway through current hogging.  Probably very inefficient.
- Neuron-style spike-train computation, in which a stimulus pulse can
  produce a much larger (synchronized) response pulse if the “neuron”
  is currently charged up enough — so you get implicit addition of
  spikes that arrive nearby in time;
- Phase-locked spike-train computation, in which a “clock” spike train
  defines 2–5 phases at which “slave” oscillators can run; depending
  on their charging rate, their phase can be advanced by feeding them
  one or more additional stimulus pulses at the right time.  Although
  the hardware is different, higher-level logic design out of such
  devices might be similar to the bistable elements described in file
  `snap-logic-ii.md` and in my Derctuo note about “majority DRAM
  logic”.
- There’s no need for all the slaves to have the same period; this
  would result in nonstop phase displacement among them.  Three slaves
  of periods 3, 4, and 5 produce a period-60 counter, spiking at the
  same time once every 60 clock spikes.
- Low-jitter pulse amplification for trigger pulses for larger devices.
- RF signal generation, either for UWB communication and ranging, or
  to produce a crude high-voltage VCO (CCO?) that can then be filtered
  to a band of interest.  Because the time-domain comb signal from an
  idealized free-running Marx includes equal amounts of all harmonics
  (dc, f, 2f, 3f, etc.) the actual frequency of interest may be far
  above the spike frequency.
- If you drive two divide-by-2 slave generators from the same master
  clock, then the *difference* between them will only contain the odd
  harmonics of the slave frequency: f, 3f, 5f, etc., notably excluding
  dc.
- Pulse density modulation, in which the device is either triggered or
  not triggered every microsecond or so.  This is appealing not only
  because of power gain (which it might or might not provide) but also
  because of the potential for driving high-impedance analog loads
  like piezoelectrics.
- RF demodulation: by keeping the Marx generator charged to the
  instantaneous voltage of a poorly filtered radio signal, then
  reliably triggering it with a “sampling-comb” pulse train at some
  harmonic of the desired frequency (say, 2×, 3×, or 4×), you will
  selectively amplify the subharmonics of the pulse-train frequency,
  effectively multiplying it by a sampling comb in the time domain,
  and therefore convolving it with a comb in the frequency domain,
  converting every subharmonic of the sampling frequency to baseband.
  For this application, the Marx generator itself is a somewhat
  suboptimal many-pole RC low-pass filter, which should mitigate the
  aliasing problem.  This requires avalanche times an order of
  magnitude or more above the frequency of interest.  Honestly a
  regular S&H is probably a lot better for this unless you can’t get a
  fast enough transistor.
- Polyphase analog filtering: by running multiple slave oscillators at
  the same period and different phase shifts, you can generate spike
  trains to multiple different analog samplers.
- Similarly for CDMA-type time-domain communication applications,
  where instead of “sampling” at regular intervals, you sample at
  times pooped out by an LFSR or something.  If you have two such
  sampling devices, each powering an integrator (or one charging an
  integrating cap and one discharging it), you ought to be able to
  decode your signal of interest from the difference.  This of course
  requires extreme temporal synchronization, but that might be doable
  in a simple PLLish way, letting the sequence generator run free at a
  slightly wrong speed until it detects a signal, and then running two
  detectors off it at a slight delay to get the phase error to drive
  the PLL.
- Powering a Cockcroft–Walton generator, for example, to fire a xenon
  strobe lamp on a camera.
- RF switching: if the capacitors in the Marx are reverse-biased
  diodes, their capacitance goes down and their impedance goes up as
  they charge up.  Every time you erect the Marx, they will discharge
  and briefly be low impedance to RF signals, before charging up
  again.  This potentially allows you to sample more than just a point
  on a signal.  It probably requires inductors on the avalanche
  elements in order to slow the edge and remove interference it would
  otherwise create in the band of interest, plus of course bias tees
  to couple the RF signal in and out.
- Generating magnetic pulses for magnetoforming, for example, aluminum
  foil.

One particularly amusing hackish thought: the avalanche elements can
be back-biased diodes, the capacitors can be beefier back-biased
diodes, and the charging speed limiters could also maybe be tiny
diodes instead of resistors, though that’s a trickier proposition;
this would enable you to do digital logic entirely out of diodes!  If
it’s possible, and fast, this seems like it would have been a killer
advantage in the 01950s and early 01960s, when transistors were
expensive and hard to get, and vacuum tubes more so; some Russian
electronics were “ferrite/diode” systems in which the diodes took care
of the combinational logic and (square-loop?) ferrite transformers
handled memory and inversion.

When I was 9, I proposed solid-state switching elements for
computation that worked on the neon-lamp-like principle of avalanche
breakdown in ionic solids.  Those probably are not practical, because
the device would require very high voltages, and its crystal structure
would rapidly lose integrity.  But avalanche discharge in solid-state
semiconductors is commonplace; it’s the way diacs, triacs, and other
thyristors and SCRs work.

### Kerry Wong’s minimal 2N3904 pulse generator ###

[Kerry Wong built a 2N3904-based pulse generator][1], running it off
120V (!!) and back-biasing the *collector*—base junction, which he
says consistently avalanches around 100V, saying:

His pulses look like only 50 volts, though, suggesting that they might
actually be much faster than 1.5 ns, and being limited by the
oscilloscope’s 150MHz input bandwidth.  Oddly, log(120V/100V)/(220kΩ
22pF) works out to about 16 kHz, not 30 kHz.

Using the huge collector-base junction instead of the teensy
emitter-base junction probably means you can handle a lot more power,
and it is at least a somewhat controlled process parameter, since
people actually do often require that their transistors resist a back
bias on the base-collector junction; [ST’s 2N3904 datasheet][5]
specifies a minimum of 60 V for the base-collector reverse breakdown
and, surprisingly, provides a minimum value for the base-emitter
reverse breakdown voltage as well: 6 V.  Interestingly, its delay time
and rise time (for normal transistor operation) are specced as 35 ns,
with 200 ns for storage time and 50 ns for fall time, and a 270 MHz
transition frequency.

This means that the pulse’s rise time is more than 20 times faster
than the pulse you’d get using the transistor *as* a transistor
*switch*, but maybe no faster or even a bit slower than if you were
using it in its linear region.  But probably the transistor is not the
limiting feature here.

He also cites [a 01997 paper by Kilpelä and Kostamovaara][4] and [a
pulse generator project by Andrew Holme][6].

### Holme’s 2N3904 pulse generator ###

Holme used a 2N3904 and an open coax transmission line rather than a
22-pF cap to get a rectangular pulse with about a 400-ps rise time,
which he says is limited by his oscilloscope.  Astonishingly, he did
this with through-hole components.

The coax transmission line suggests how to get arbitrarily high gain
from such a circuit, considered as an amplifier: an arbitrarily short
input pulse can produce an arbitrarily long output pulse, as long as
the current is high enough to maintain the avalanche but not high
enough to overheat the transistor.  (I think you can do this with a
capacitor too — it’s just messier.)

Holme mentions that you can trigger the circuit by applying short
pulses to the base, which is a thing I hadn’t thought of; both Wong
and Holme are taking their main signal from the emitter and just tying
the base to ground through a big resistor.  I suppose that you’d pull
the base *negative* to trigger it in that case, thus increasing
|V<sub>CB</sub>| enough to cause an avalanche — just treating the
transistor as a pair of back-to-back diodes?  (This is wrong; see
below.)

Holme also cites Jim Williams’s Linear AN72 and [AN94][7].  I guess
when Analog bought Linear they broke the link, but [I found it
anyway][10].

### AN94: The Taming of the Slew ###

[Jim Williams’s AN94][10] is about measuring an amplifier slew rate at
2.8 GV/s, for which he had to build a 360ps-rise-time 15–20V pulse
generator for this purpose, because his fancy 1-ns rise-time pulse
generator was too slow for the amplifier he was measuring, but
subnanosecond-rise-time pulse generators cost US$10k–30k.  So he used
a 2N2501 (or maybe a 2N2369) as an avalanche transistor, biasing its
collector to 70 volts above ground.  Interestingly, my understanding
of triggering with a base pulse is incorrect, at least for this
circuit: he uses a *positive-going* trigger pulse into the base of the
avalanche transistor to trigger the avalanche, which I’d’ve thought
would be counterproductive.  He AC-couples the trigger pulse with a
5pF cap and protects the avalanche transistor’s base with a Schottky
up from ground.

The 2N2501 looks like a perfectly ordinary (but old) small-signal NPN
transistor: 350 MHz, β≈50 (or >3.5 for small signals), 40V minimum
V<sub>(BR)CBO</sub>, 1.2 W, 100 mA; the 2N2369 is pretty similar, but
maybe 500 MHz and 200 mA.  The datasheets show them in a 01960s-style
TO-18 metal can rather than a modern TO-220 or similar epoxy package;
[an advertisement for the 2N2501 appeared in the May 4, 01964 issue of
*Electronics*][11], though with only 20V “BV<sub>CBO</sub>”, and both
transistors appear in the [1965 Motorola Semiconductor Data
Manual][12], with ratings more like the 40V I mentioned earlier.
Neither is billed as an avalanche transistor or has a datasheet with
avalanche characteristics, and there’s nothing to suggest that they
can in any way be used to generate 400-picosecond edges.

I wonder if Williams used them even in 02003 instead of more modern
parts because the modern parts were “much improved” — in the sense of
having an inconveniently higher base-collector breakdown voltage.
Williams comments that not every transistor of this model was
suitable:

### AN72: A Seven-Nanosecond Comparator ###

Previously Williams wrote [AN72][9], which also covers the technique,
but at less length; most of AN72 is a primer on the basics of working
with VHF and faster circuits.
