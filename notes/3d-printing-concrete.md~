Another variant of the overall powder-bed process for printing in
concrete is to trowel on plastic layers, made of a thixotropic aqueous
paste of sand, water, perhaps reinforcers like chopped basalt fibers
or straw, and a water-soluble temporary binder like sugar,
carboxymethylcellulose, clay, or gelatinized starch; then, on each
layer, selectively deposit a permanent cement such as waterglass,
slaked lime, plaster of Paris, magnesium oxychloride, or ordinary
portland cement.  This requires the layers to be thin enough, relative
to the mobility of the cement molecules, that the cement can diffuse
down to the previous layer before it sets, or they require you to
deposit the cement vigorously enough to penetrate the whole layer.  In
the case of a slaked-lime binder, you'd have to perforate an array of
air holes at the end of the process to allow CO2 to diffuse to all the
layers.  Such objects wouldn't need to be baked; they'd just need the
uncemented material to be washed away with a water hose once the
cement was set.
