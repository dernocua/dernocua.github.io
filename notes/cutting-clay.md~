Watching a video on "[clean cutting with polymer clay cutters][0]".
The author gets 3-D printed cookie cutters to cut a previously rolled
sheet of "clay" cleanly by first sticking it to something it will
stick to, like glass or ceramic, then scraping it off afterwards, a
process which may distort it.  However, they also point out that
putting plastic wrap over the top of the "clay" will keep the cutter
from sticking to it, and then the plastic can be peeled away; and then
the bubbles trapped under the wrap produce little shallow hollows in
the surface.

A couple of interesting thoughts:

- This probably works with real clay too.

- You could probably use a rolling wheel to "cut" the clay sheet
  through the plastic sheet, giving you a vinyl-cutting-plotter-like
  capability.  Certainly you can repeatedly push something like the
  end of a butter knife through it.  Making multiple trips
