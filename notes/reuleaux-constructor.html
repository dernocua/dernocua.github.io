(7 minutes)</div><p>Reading <a href="https://archive.org/details/constructor01reul">F. Reuleaux’s <em>The Constructor</em></a>, in Henry Harrison
Suplee’s 01893 English translation of the German fourth edition, 340
pp. including the covers and title pages.  Apparently the first
edition dates from 01861!  But Suplee says his 01893 translation is
the first English edition.</p>
<p>I think it’s reasonable to see <em>The Constructor</em> as mostly a
19th-century version of the <em>Machinery’s Handbook</em>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/machineryshandbo00indu">the 01924 sixth
edition of which has been in the public domain since January 1,
02020</a>, except that Reuleaux focuses almost exclusively on the
machines to be built, not the processes of building them.  (Before the
<em>Handbook</em>, Oberg started out by writing a toolmaker’s handbook for
small tools.)  It is only one tenth the size of the <em>Handbook</em> (or a
little over one fifth the size of its 1610-page 01924 edition) and it
is enormously more readable.</p>
<h2>Guiding tables</h2>
<p>An introduction briefly covering Reuleaux’s theory of kinematics and
“phoronomics” is given on pp. vi–xv (12-21/340).  A table of contents
is present on pp. xvi–xviii (22-24/340).  An alphabetical index
occupies pp. 303–312 (327–336/340).  An introduction to strength of
materials, with various kinds of stresses and strains, but excluding
the buckling of Euler columns, is given on pp. 1–18 (column buckling
is covered on pp. 82–84), and a graphical method of calculation
(“graphostatics”) is given on pp. 22–38.  The remainder of the book,
except for a short series of mathematical tables on pp. 291–301, is
Section III, mostly organized as a catalog of different kinds of
mechanisms and machine construction, accompanies with both lucid
theoretical explanations and data tables.</p>
<p><em>Not</em> included are optics, chemistry, metallurgy (except in the
broadest sense), machining processes (such as drilling, grinding,
lapping, and boring), metrology, feedback control, vibrations and
resonances, fluid mechanics (?), ceramics, cams, testing,
thermodynamics, textile processes such as weaving and spinning,
lithography, and electricity; but substantial attention is given to
hydraulics (though not to sliding seals), pneumatics, and tension
members such as belts and ropes, as well as some other sorts of
manufacturing processes such as rolling.  And of course no attention
is given to polymers except for rubber, since that art was but little
developed in 01893.</p>

<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>Terminology has changed substantially since Reuleaux’s time.  “Latent
forces” are now, I think, called “stiffness” or “rigidity”.  Most
confusingly, Reuleaux’s “strain” S is what we now call “stress”.  His
“tensile strength” is a stress, and I think it is the ultimate
strength, not the yield stress.  “Modulus of resistance” T seems to
mean yield strength, and “modulus of rupture” K seems to be the
ultimate strength, same as “tensile strength”, suggesting I’m
misunderstanding one of them.  “Modulus of elasticity” E is the
familiar Young’s modulus of elasticity.  “Theoretical resistance” is,
I think, the <em>force</em> (as opposed to the stress or strain) exceeding
the yield strength.  “Toughness” has its modern meaning.</p>
<p>(The 01924 edition of the <em>Machinery’s Handbook</em> already uses the
modern terminology, so possibly Suplee rather than antiquity is to
blame for the nonstandard terminology.)</p>
<p>In many cases Reuleaux tried to introduce new terminology that was not
adopted: he considers valves to be “ratchets for pressure organs” (or
rather the pawls thereof), pipes to be “conductors for pressure
organs”, etc.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/contrivances.html">Contrivances</a> (45 notes)
