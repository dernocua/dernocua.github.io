2-D cutting fabrication techniques like laser cutting, plasma torch
table cutting, waterjet cutting, and CNC milling are often immensely
faster than 3-D printing.  But they typically require more fabrication
steps and more difficult design.

Cutting sheet metal in particular is promising because you can bend it
after cutting, both hardening it and getting a 3-D shape.  Given some
sort of press, you can bend it by pressing it between dies cut from
the same sheet metal, either many of them stacked up or a smaller
number in a crisscross pattern (ideally not quite at 90Â°).  With
something like a beading roller, you can use a fairly small die to
make a fairly large part.  Metal has a lot of other advantages.

Another potentially interesting process for getting a solid 3-D
surface from a 2-D contour is to roll up or accordion-fold a strip,
using some minimal number of alignment slots to get the successive
layers properly aligned.

Laminated sheet metal is actually better than solid metal for
electromagnetic purposes, although random mild steel will perform an
order of magnitude worse than genuine electrical steel.  Permanent
magnets are not needed for variable reluctance motors.

Ultimately I think the figure of merit that matters most for digital
fabrication processes is the "matter bandwidth", which (being rusty on
my Shannon) I roughly define as the number of bits exceeding the noise
floor you can impress into a physical object per second.  If you can
produce a surface with 100-micron precision, then the height of a
point on that surface anywhere in a 3.2-mm range counts as 5 bits.
But if you have 10-micron precision, that's a little over 8 bits.  The
reason is that if you can make things more precise, you can make them
smaller, while if you suffer less precision, they have to be bigger.

And smaller is actually faster.  After having a system that works at
all, speed is my most important goal: being able to iterate quickly
will enable me to overcome almost any obstacle at all, from fragility
(because I can make a stock of spare parts in time) to debugging
(because I can try many things) to political opposition (because it
arises too slowly to be relevant).  This is an enormous reversal from
coal-age industrial processes in which mass production and mass
processing was of paramount importance.

Very roughly, I think that for a production time of one month (2.6
megaseconds) and a production complexity of a million "voxels", one
voxel per 2.6 seconds is adequate.  But an order of magnitude better
than that would get us out of marginal territory.  Given that existing
machinery (e.g., laser and inkjet printers) is seven orders of
magnitude faster than this, and even RepRap FDM printers are about 10
voxels per second, it seems likely to be achievable, but of course
that's drawing on billions of dollars of industrial infrastructure in
the form of semiconductor fabs.
