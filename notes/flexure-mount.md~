I was watching a [video about the Open Source Ecology large 3-D
printer][0] and the problems they're having with bushing misalignment.
Basically the problem is that they have this big 3-D-printed block
with spaces in it for bronze bushings, so that it will ride smoothly
and with low friction on a pair of steel rods, but it doesn't.

The problem is diagnosed to be misalignment: the bushings are
12-micron tolerance, so a 12-micron deviation in the shape of the
cavity they fit into is enough to get them out of tolerance, and
possibly make them nonparallel enough that the rod can't
