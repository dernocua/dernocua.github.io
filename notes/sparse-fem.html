(2 minutes)</div><p>Normally finite elements are constant, linear, quadratic, or cubic, so
you have a relatively limited number of trial functions per element,
and a relatively large number of elements.  In a three-dimensional
element, an arbitrary scalar cubic polynomial has 20 degrees of
freedom (coefficients).  In three dimensions, the number of
coefficients ((<em>d</em>+1)(<em>d</em>+2)(<em>d</em>+3)/6, see <a href="../notes/polynomial-pascal.html">Binomial coefficients and the dimensionality of spaces of polynomials</a>) grows as the cube of the degree, which gets
annoying quickly, so normally instead of adding more coefficients you
just use smaller elements.  (Also, as I understand it, normally you
impose continuity conditions which reduce this dimensionality greatly,
as with cubic splines in one dimension.)</p>
<p>(There are lots of sets of 20 polynomials you can use as a basis for
this 20-dimensional space, even a convenient orthogonal basis.)</p>
<p>But suppose that, instead of using low-degree piecewise polynomials,
we use a smaller number of larger elements, each with a
much-higher-dimensionality function space, and then try to keep things
computationally tractable by seeking a <em>sparse</em> approximation in that
larger space, or at least, a sparse state evolution rule over time?</p>
<p>In a sense this is the farthest thing from a new idea; it’s how
Fourier solved the heat equation and Wiener solved everything, by
lumping the entire system into a single element and picking basis
functions that were eigenfunctions of temporal evolution, so the
system evolves independently in each of these “vibrational modes”,
making computation enormously easier.</p>
<p>Fourier space is of course a useful space to seek a sparse
approximation of lots of things, but there are numerous other
alternatives, including chirplets and all kinds of wavelets.</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/math.html">Math</a> (11 notes)
