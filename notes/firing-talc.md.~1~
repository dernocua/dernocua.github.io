Talc is very interesting, particularly for cyclic fabrication systems,
because it [calcines to enstatite and silica][a61] at 800–840°, and
the enstatite (MgSiO₃) converts to clinoenstatite at 1200° (?), and
the quartz to cristobalite at 1300°; enstatite [melts at some
1550°][a62] and quartz/cristobalite at 1713°.  You could think of
enstatite as being a quartz/forsterite eutectic, and indeed 1543° [is
the lowest-melting point in the quartz/forsterite continuum][a63], but
the cristobalite crystals
