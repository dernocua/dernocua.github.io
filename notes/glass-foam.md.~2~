You can get neutral waterglass to foam up into an open-cell-foam glass
just by heating it to its softening point (I didn’t measure with a
thermometer, maybe 500°?) over the course of a few minutes.  The
structure of the resulting foam is fairly coarse, and the density is
not that low.

How
---

A couple of possibilities occur to me to improve the structure.

Water is probably the best blowing agent for this kind of thing, just
based on its low molecular weight.  Ammonia might be a possibility,
too.

First, waterglass solution doesn’t solidify at room temperature until
it’s something like 35% waterglass by mass, and so when you heat it up
slowly, any water in excess of that 65% (or even a bit more, since
solubility increases at higher temperatures) will bubble out in the
liquid state, before the solid foam can form.  Adding small amounts of
polyvalent cations (such as calcium or magnesium, or maybe even
aluminum or boron) is well known to decrease its solubility to by
orders of magnitude, so perhaps they could permit the formation of a
solid hydrogel with much higher water content, perhaps 90%, 99%, or
99.9%, with a corresponding decrease in the density of the final
product.  There must be some density limit below which you get glass
mist rather than glass foam, but given how viscous glasses can be just
above their softening point, the limit might be pretty low.

Second, if the expansion is carried out very quickly rather than over
a period of time, bubbles will have less time to coalesce into larger
bubbles and convert the foam into the open-cell form.  So perhaps the
solid hydrogel precursor could be foamed more effectively in the way
that rice and breakfast cereals were originally puffed (and still are
by roadside vendors in China and Korea), by first heating it under
pressure to its softening point, then suddenly releasing the pressure.
For most cereals this is done by heating the cereal to the proper
temperature inside a cereal cannon, then whacking the valve on the
front of the cannon with a hammer, allowing the cereal to blow the
cannon door open; but for popcorn it is instead done by encasing a
small ball of the starch hydrogel in a hermetic hull which contains
the pressure until it ruptures.  Both possibilities might work to
produce lighter-weight glass foam.

In the cannon case, there’s the risk that the glass hydrogel will
completely melt inside the pressure chamber and stick together into a
single mass, and also to its walls.  If the hydrogel is initially
produced in granules, their surfaces can be treated to prevent this,
for example by rolling them in quartz flour (which can be made to
stick either by doing it before they have finished solidifying, by
making the quartz flour hot enough to partially melt the surface, or
by a hot air blast) or by replacing most of the alkali ions near their
surface with polyvalent cations like those mentioned above.

Many minerals might serve as viable alternatives to quartz flour here,
including chalk, quicklime, alabaster, magnesia, zeolites, clays,
talc, feldspar, aluminum hydroxide, mica, or rutile — almost any
mineral used in formulating ceramic clay bodies or glazes will have a
much higher melting point than the waterglass hydrogel, except perhaps
oxides of lead.  Boric acid and borax don’t have a higher melting
point, but still might be an alternative, by forming a borosilicate
network in the surface of the granule.

Most of these treatments to increase the melting point of the
granules’ surfaces would also increase the surface’s strength, which
would permit the use of the cannon-free popcorn process.

An alternative means of puffing rice is “hot salt frying”, in which
salt is heated to a high enough temperature to puff rice (but not melt
the salt), and then the rice (often parboiled) is mixed into it.  The
hot salt transfers heat to the rice much more rapidly than hot air
would at ordinary velocities, so the rice puffs instead of dehydrating
through vapor diffusion as it normally would.  The coarse-grained
puffed rice is then easily sieved out of the fine-grained salt.
Modern continuous-process cereal puffing works the same way, but using
high-speed air or steam rather than solids.  This might be a viable
alternative way to rapidly foam waterglass hydrogels, but media you
wouldn’t want in your food could be used instead of the
salt — anything from the foregoing litany of quartz, chalk, quicklime,
etc., and also carbon.  These would permit the use of higher puffing
temperatures.  Using air, of course, would permit puffing glass at
higher temperatures still, but its low thermal conductivity and
thermal density means you need high-pressure air jets.

You could load a refractory mold full of many such beads of the
hydrogel, but without any such surface treatment, then run hot air or
steam through the mold cavity at high speed in order to expand all the
grains and cause them to fuse together, like expanded polystyrene.
This could be a pretty quick process if the grains are small; the hot
air could convert them into a sort of fluidized bed.

Why
---

The glass foam resulting from foaming waterglass can be abraded or
sawn (or crushed) very easily, and the possibility of cutting it with
a hot wire, like styrofoam, is very appealing, especially if its
density can be decreased further.  Although it’s quite weak, it could
be very useful for supporting granular slightly-denser materials such
as perlite, vermiculite, alumina foam, and cheap carbon foam, for
example while an adhesive sets (see file `leaf-resin-roof.md` for one
use for this).  Because of its relatively low melting point and very
low density, it might be possible to “burn it out” in such cases,
leaving only a thin layer of residue.

A different way of using this glass foam to support stronger materials
is to first get it into the right shape (whether by expanding beads
into a mold, gluing together a bunch of pre-expanded beads and pushing
them into a mold, by cutting or abrading at low temperatures, or by
hot-wire cutting) and then use the resulting form as either a mold or
a stucco substrate.  This is more or less the same way styrofoam is
used for molding, for example, concrete, or as a base for a fiberglass
layup.  By painting, spraying, wrapping, laying up, or otherwise
depositing a stronger material onto its surface, you can make a
strong, hard shell.  This may need to be done in stages, first
building up a lightweight shell that can be supported by the foam,
then a stronger shell supported by the lightweight shell, then perhaps
a solid object filling the whole shell.

Why would you use glass foam for this rather than styrofoam?  Well, it
doesn't require any organic materials, so it’s potentially much
cheaper.  Being more rigid means you can cut it to precise dimensions
more easily, and it will bend less when you’re doing things to it that
impose slight side loads, like painting or stuccoing it.  It can
withstand common solvents without any complaint, unlike styrofoam, and
it can withstand higher temperatures than any organic polymer.
Counterintuitively, it might be possible to get it to a *lower*
density than styrofoam, because silicate glass (even waterglass) has a
much higher strength-to-weight ratio than polystyrene.  My subjective
impression is that even the foamed waterglass I’ve made with the crude
direct process of slow heating is about as light as polystyrene.

Also, if the density gets low enough, you can use glass foam for
lost-foam casting, particularly for casting of materials like basalt,
fused quartz, lead glass, or soda-lime glass that will happily
dissolve the glass-foam residues.
