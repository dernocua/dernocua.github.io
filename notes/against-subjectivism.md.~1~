In a discussion recently, I saw someone say (slightly edited for
readability and formatting):

> *The* truth?  Engage in discussion in a productive way?  These
> really don’t seem to be my things. ...  I’m not interested in
> discussing things with people who believe in *the* truth (or that
> they *know* it).  ... In my opinion, truth is being *established*

  I want to emphasize that this is not a straw man; it is a literal
transcript of something that someone actually said to me, improbable
as it sounds.  Therefore I think it is worthwhile to clearly explain
why it is untrue.

  It struck me as a particularly clear statement of a malignant
doctrine, a collective variant of metaphysical solipsism, that I’ve
often seen in a more covert form.  It’s a hopelessly confused
metaphysical doctrine which eliminates both the possibility of
rational action and the possibility of any basis for agreement, other
than submission or compromise; scholars call it “[global alethic
relativism][relativism]”.

  First, though, let me explain what is *true* about this view.

People commonly accept social constructions as facts and cannot easily tell the difference
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are *many* statements that people commonly accept as “true” that
are in fact socially constructed rather than objectively true in any
sense: my property extends up to such-and-such a line; masturbating in
public is unacceptable; *The Da Vinci Code* is not yet out of
copyright; saying that someone is “nice” is saying that they treat
others well.  Clearly the community could change its collective mind
about where the property line is drawn, what sorts of behavior are
acceptable and unacceptable, what causes bizarre human behaviors, the
terms of copyright, and the definitions of words.

  People nearly always act as if things like national boundaries,
corporations, ghosts, demonic possessions, marriages, and land tenure
rights *exist* in the same objective, material sense that stone walls
or puppies do.  This is very practically defensible: you cannot run
through a stone wall by disbelieving in it, and in the same way you
cannot run through a heavily armed international border by
disbelieving in it, because even though the border is socially
constructed, the armaments and the border guards wielding them are
objectively, materially real.  

  But, in fact, when it comes to such things, there is indeed no such
thing as *the* truth; the truth of a marriage, a corporation, a
national border, or a law is established between people, within
communities.  It does not exist outside of a social context and does
not inhabit any discussion before common ground is found.

  The relevant difference is that if *the border guards* stop
believing in the national boundary, or can be tricked about where it
is, then you can cross it without changing anything in the material
world other than people’s beliefs and expectations.  This does not
work with stone walls.

  But this extremist form of relativism also calls into question
propositions such as whether there is a stone wall in front of you,
the commutativity of integer multiplication, or whether Elvis Presley
is still alive.

The obvious problem with alethic relativism is that it affirms nonsense
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

At first glance it would seem to foreclose only the possibility of any
basis for agreement other than mere popularity.  It entails that
geocentrism was actually true before Copernicus and Galileo made it
unpopular, and heliocentrism was false, because the community of the
Catholic Church had established the truth of geocentrism.  It argues
that whether there is or is not a stone wall in front of you is a
truth that can only exist inside of a social context, established
between people, within communities.  It entails that exterminating
sparrows and deep plowing in the Great Leap Forward was to result in
abundance rather than famine, because the social context had
established that it would.  It asserts that the only difference
between truth and lies is that people disbelieve lies.

That is, it cannot distinguish between truth and collective ignorance
or self-delusion.

Worse, it can’t even agree on which nonsense to affirm in which context
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

But, in fact, the problem goes much deeper!  According to this radical
form of relativism, it isn’t even objectively true that the Catholic
Church was preaching geocentrism, or that the Inquisition put Galileo
under house arrest for teaching heliocentrism, or for that matter that
our own community subscribes to heliocentrism.  If saying that some
proposition *X* is true means only that some community has accepted
*X* as true, then it would be equally valid for the following “truths”
to “exist” by “being established” within a different community or
social context:

> The Catholic Church was teaching heliocentrism and Galileo, who was
> never put under house arrest, was teaching geocentrism.  Nowadays
> most people accept geocentrism.  The Great Leap Forward did not
> promote exterminating sparrows or deep plowing.

Alethic relativism contradicts itself when we look at what people believe
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In an ontological sense, [this is incoherent][refutation], in a way
shown by Plato; the SEP summarizes his argument as follows:

> Most people believe that Protagoras’s doctrine is false.  
> Protagoras, on the other hand, believes his doctrine to be true.  
> By his own doctrine, Protagoras must believe that his opponents’
> view is true.  
> Therefore, Protagoras must believe that his own doctrine is false.  

[refutation]: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#AleRelChaSelRef "Alethic Relativism and the charge of self-refutation."

  Plato’s version of this argument is considerably lengthier and is
quoted in full at the end of this note; as the SEP notes, though, this
argument begs the question, implicitly relying on a notion of absolute
rather than relative truth.  Protagoras must believe that his
opponents’ view is true *for them*.

And it makes predictions very much at odds with reality

[Borges, in _Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_][tlon] writes (my translation

  Such techniques do not work in our world, individually or in groups,
so we can conclude that alethic relativism is false; that there exists
a truth, an objective reality, independent of our communities, outside
of a social context, even before common ground is found.

  Of course, this too begs the question — it relies on the presumption
that it is *objectively true* that such events do not happen in our
world, while a relativist might argue that *for us* they do not
happen, while *for them* such events *do* happen.  I have not yet met
a relativist who has dared to make such an argument, but in this way
alethic relativism could insulate itself from all possible disproof,
just as ordinary solipsism does.

  As [the Wikipedia article on social constructionism complains][wp],
“It has been objected that strong social constructionism undermines
the foundation of science as the pursuit of objectivity and, as a
theory, defies any attempt at falsifying it.”

[wp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism

Alethic relativism would render science, engineering, and the rest of philosophy impossible
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what?  Why is it worth talking about?  Many people believe many
false and incoherent things, but we don’t spend all our time
constructing detailed refutations of each of them.  What makes this
doctrine so “malignant” it’s worth our attention?

  I have two major concerns with this sort of willful blindness to
objective reality, which accepts popularity contests as superior to
empirical evidence or logical reasoning: it is guaranteed to render
disagreements unresolvable, and it makes rational action impossible.
It’s a collective variant of solipsism in the sense that, rather than
proposing that *I* am alone in the universe, it proposes that *we* are
alone in the universe; every other fact is taken to be merely a social
consensus, only “true” relative to the community that established it,
possibly “false” relative to other communities.  By deluding its
adherents into rejecting the universe, it tempts them to “establish
truths” by collective partisan violence rather than by logic and
evidence, violence that ultimately ends in self-destruction.

  Of course, people commonly disagree on empirical questions like
whether Elvis Presley is still alive or not, as well as logical or
mathematical questions like whether it is true that [every even whole
number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers][goldbach], for
example due to access to differing evidence or due to limitations in
their reasoning.

  And people commonly differ in their interpretation of language; one
person may interpret a sentence as a proposition that is true, while
another interprets it as a diiferent proposition that is false.  For example,
the sentence “every even whole number is the sum of two prime numbers”
depends on the definition of “prime number”; it is trivially false
according to our modern definition (in which 1 is not a prime number),
because 2 is a example, but when Euler originally stated Goldbach’s
conjecture, he stated it that way because he was using a definition of
“prime numbers” (or rather, “prīmī”, using a Latin word) that included
1 as a “prime”.  Thus our interpretation of a sentence, for example in
English, German, or Latin, depends on the socially constructed
meanings of the words in it.  (“Nice” used to mean “insignificant”,
too.)

  But these sorts of disagreement presuppose the existence of an
objective reality that could, in principle, resolve them.  Alethic
relativism, by contrast, claims that it is merely a matter of social
consensus — opinion — whether Elvis is alive or dead, or
whether 2 + 2 = 4.  It claims that there is no objective sense in
which Elvis is dead or alive, or in which 2 + 2 = 4, so there is no
point in talking about it except to establish social consensus.

Protagoras’s argument doesn’t become any more coherent when applied to
communities rather than individuals.
