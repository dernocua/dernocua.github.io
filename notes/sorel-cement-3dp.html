(1 minute)</div><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-sorel-cement-kiran-k">“Kiran K” of Larsen and Toubro reports that Sorel cement is sensitive
to X-rays</a> and strong DC electric fields — they prevent it from
setting.  (Even more astonishingly, he claims polarized laser light
affects its setting.)</p>
<p>What if this is true?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.che.utah.edu/~ring/Publications-PDFs/J-127.pdf" title="Terry A. Ring and Eric Ping “Sorel Cement Reactions and Their Kinetics,” Proceedings AICHE Annual meeting Salt Lake City, 2008.">Ring and Ping</a> give more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cements formulated near the stoichiometry of the 5-phase [i.e., 5MgO
+ 1MgCl₂] reaction, e.g. 0.8987 kg/L (7.5 lbs/gal) and 28.9±0.15%
MgCl₂ brine, are the strongest.  Kinetic experiments observed that
the 5-phase is formed quickly, but the kinetics are not complete for
several days. The cement does not set by the 5-phase reaction when
exposed to Cu Kα x-rays but gives a putty like form having
MgCl₂*6H₂O crystals that do not set into a cement. These are the
first observations of x-ray altered cementation reaction kinetics.</p>

<p>Does this mean you could use X-rays to 3-D print an object out of
Sorel cement?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/materials.html">Materials</a> (59 notes)
