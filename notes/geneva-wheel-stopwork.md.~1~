Watching the “Clickspring” series of videos on hobby clockwork, I came
across the section about the “stopwork”, which stops the mainspring
from being wound by more than, say, five turns.

The way this is done is very simple.  A pair of defective gears mesh;
one is held in place only by friction, and has five teeth, with the
rest of the gear solid out to the tip of the teeth.
