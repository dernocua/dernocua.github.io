(5 minutes)</div><p>I’ve been thinking more about chemical reactions that can produce
inorganic solids that are hard and/or strong and/or refractory from
conveniently shapable precursors.  Previously I was mostly thinking of
things that react in aqueous solution, but now I’ve also been thinking
about granular substances you could mold into shape (in some kind of
carrier, such as a thermoset resin) and then heat up to activate the
reaction.</p>
<p>In Dercuano in file <code>berlinite-gel</code> I mentioned Grover et al.’s
low-temperature synthesis of alumina ceramics bonded by berlinite
(aluminum orthophosphate) by partly dissolving alumina in aqueous 50
wt% phosphoric acid at 130° (with a 5:1 weight ratio of alumina to
phosphoric acid) for 1–4 days, then heating the resulting a thick
puttylike gel of hydrated aluminum phosphate to only 150° for 1–3 days
to get a 20%-porosity solid of nearly 50 MPa compressive strength.
Similar substances (“MALP” or “MAP”) are widely sold as castable
refractories.  (See <a href="../notes/cola-flavor.html">Cola flavor</a> for more on this substance.)</p>
<p>With respect to adding phosphate cross-linkers, the ammonium
phosphates should not be overlooked; some are deliquescent under
ordinary conditions, easily dehydrated to crystallinity with gentle
heating, and yield phosphoric acid when the ammonia is driven off with
stronger heating.</p>
<p>An interesting benefit of phosphoric acid as a binder (or acid
phosphates like monoaluminum phosphate or monomagnesium phosphate) is
that it can bind silicates like soda-lime glass, but doesn’t destroy
them the way lye does.  Soda-lime glass fiber is only about US$3/kg,
according to <a href="../notes/refractories.html">Potential local sources  and prices of refractory materials</a>, which is enormously cheaper than
any alternative fiber reinforcement of similar strength.  Maybe by
combining phosphoric acid, some kind of high-strength foam (see <a href="../notes/glass-foam.html">Glass foam</a>) and oriented glass fiber, you could produce a
structure analogous to wood.  Space Shuttle TPS protective LI-900 HRSI
tiles were a felt of fused-quartz fibers, but they were adhered
together with, I think, borosilicate.</p>
<p>More discussion of such composite materials is in <a href="../notes/fiberglass-cmc.html">Fiberglass CMCs?</a>.</p>
<p>A different way to get phosphates of aluminum might be to react
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_aluminate">sodium aluminate</a>, easily prepared by digesting aluminum in lye,
with a soluble phosphate, such as one of the phosphates of sodium or
ammonium.  I seem to have had some success with this with fire; see <a href="../notes/material-observations.html">Material observations</a>, 02021-08-06.
WP says sodium aluminate is thus used to precipitate
soluble phosphates in water treatment plants.</p>
<p>Sources of aluminum may be other useful bonding agents; water-soluble
sodium aluminate precipitates aluminum hydroxide in water upon
cooling, part of the Bayer process; even the insoluble hydroxide
itself may serve as a useful bonding agent due to its tendency to form
a metastable hydrogel which eventually crystallizes.  Calcining the
hydroxide yields sapphire.</p>
<p>Aluminates of calcium are also potentially interesting, especially for
3-D printing; the highly reactive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricalcium_aluminate">tricalcium aluminate</a> is
notorious for causing “flash setting” of concrete immediately upon
hydration, though a small amount of sulfate can prevent this.  WP
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water reacts instantly with tricalcium aluminate.  Hydration likely
begins already during grinding of cement clinker due to residual
humidity and dehydration of gypsum additives.  Initial contact with
water causes protonation of single bonded oxygen atoms on aluminate
rings and leads to the formation of calcium hydroxide.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_aluminate">4</a> The next
steps in the sequence of the hydration reaction involve the
generated hydroxide ions as strong nucleophiles, which fully
hydrolyze the ring structure in combination with water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course if you want to 3-D print a stone object by spraying
water onto a powder bed, this kind of instant setting may be highly
desirable, and tricalcium aluminate's other deleterious effects on
concrete may not be relevant.</p>
<p>My previous thought of precipitating calcium phosphate through a
double metathesis reaction still might work as a cement, even with
melting rather than in a solvent system.  It’s similarly fairly
instant.  I had settled on calcium chloride and agricultural
diammonium phosphate, and the thought at the time was an aqueous
reaction; but DAP decomposes to yield liquid phosphoric acid (and
other crap) at only 155°, which I think can attack the solid calcium
chloride (which melts at 772°).  Maybe it can also attack solid
metallic aluminum to get phosphates of aluminum.  Monoammonium
phosphate is cleaner, decomposing to yield only ammonia and phosphoric
acid at I think a slightly higher temperature.</p>
