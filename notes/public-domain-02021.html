(15 minutes)</div><p>Writing <a href="../notes/reuleaux-constructor.html">Some notes on reading parts of Reuleaux’s engineering handbook</a> I learned that the <a href="https://archive.org/details/machineryshandbo00indu">01924 Sixth
Edition of the <em>Machinery’s Handbook</em></a> has finally served its
sentence of copyright and graduated into the public domain.  It
occurred to me to check what else had recently thus graduated, in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_in_public_domain">02021</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_in_public_domain">02020</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinery's_Handbook">Evidently there was a 7-volume <em>Machinery’s Encyclopedia</em></a>, also
by Oberg and Jones, but unfortunately <a href="https://archive.org/details/machinerysencyc00jonegoog">only Volume 7 seems to be in
the Archive so far</a>, and that one is scanned by Google, though it
was less ineptly carried out than the great mass of Google’s book
scans.  It is the “Index and Guide to Systematic Reading”.  Strangely,
the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, or at least that volume thereof, seems to be
devoid of illustrations.</p>
<p>Oberg died in 01951, but his coauthor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Jones">Franklin Day Jones</a> didn’t
die until 01967.  As I understand it, this means that, in countries
that sentence copyrighted works to life plus 70 years, and do not
observe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_the_shorter_term">rule of the shorter term</a>, even the 01914 First
Edition of <em>Machinery’s Handbook</em> will not be set free until 02037.
Argentina and the EU do observe the rule of the shorter term, for
example, but Germany does not.</p>
<p>Edgar Rice Burroughs’s <em>Tarzan</em> and <em>Barsoom</em> stories call attention;
though they were published since 01925, Burroughs has been dead since
01950, so in countries that limit copyright to life plus 70 years,
they are now fair game.  Similarly Shaw; Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em> and
<em>1984</em>; Olaf Stapledon; Rex Ingram’s <em>The Prisoner of Zenda</em>, the
first Ruritanian fiction; all of Korzybski’s œuvre on General
Semantics; Edna St. Vincent Millay; and Schumpeter.  Gurdjieff died in
01949, and so did Margaret Mitchell (<em>Gone with the Wind</em>) and Richard
Strauss.</p>
<p>In countries that limit copyright to life plus 50 years, the work of
everyone who died in 01970 has now graduated into the public domain,
notably Carnap, Russell, E. M. Forster, Jimi Hendrix, Mishima, Nasser,
Rube Goldberg, and the <em>Death be not Proud</em> of Gunther.  Adorno,
Eisenhower, Gropius, Kerouac, Meher Baba, and John Wyndham died in
01969.  Unfortunately of these only Nasser is actually <em>from</em> such a
country, so this doesn’t help those of us laboring under more
oppressive copyright regimes, even if they observe the rule of the
shorter term.  Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand, Qatar, the UAE, Tunisia,
Bolivia, Iran, and the PRC are notable bright spots here, and Mexico
observes life + 50 for deaths before 01944-01-01, and Russia and
Switzerland, 01943-01-01.  India and Venezuela are currently life plus
60 years.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/10/21/satirist-tom-lehrer-put-his-songs-into-public-domain/">Tom Lehrer effectively released all his songs to the public
domain in 02020</a>, <a href="https://tomlehrersongs.com/" title="Note: This website will be shut down on December 31, 2024, so if you want to download anything, don’t wait too long.">using his own website</a>.</p>
<p>The rule of the shorter term has liberated all US works published up
to 01925 (and, less significantly, all works published up to 01925,
for users in the US); <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2021/">in 02021, that gave us</a> <em>The Great Gatsby</em>,
Woolf’s <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>, and Agatha Christie’s <em>The Secret of
Chimneys</em>, and <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2020/">in 02020</a> Burroughs’s <em>Tarzan and the Ant Men</em>,
Agatha Christie’s <em>The Man in the Brown Suit</em>, <em>Doctor Dolittle’s
Circus</em>, Gershwin’s <em>Rhapsody in Blue</em>, and W.E.B. Du Bois’s <em>The Gift
of Black Folk</em>.  <em>The Boxcar Children</em> was published in 01924, and
<em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em> in 01922.  <a href="https://archive.org/details/babbittlew00lewi">Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt</a> also
seems to be popular, and his <em>Main Street</em> was published in 01920.
Not until 01926 would <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> and <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em>
appear (which last was published first in England), and we don’t get
<em>The Sound and the Fury</em> or <em>A Farewell to Arms</em> until 01929.</p>
<p>In nonfiction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1925_non-fiction_books">01925 gave us</a> Ronald A. Fisher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Methods_for_Research_Workers"><em>Statistical
Methods for Research Workers</em></a>, in which frequentism was born;
Walter Lippmann’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Public"><em>The Phantom Public</em></a>, on Mussolini’s
manipulation of public opinion, proposing the agent/bystander
dichotomy; Napoleon Hill’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_of_Success"><em>The Law of Success</em></a>, from which the
entire genre of soft-headed modern self-help books derives; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bolshevik_Myth"><em>The
Bolshevik Myth</em></a>, by anarchist Alexander Berkman, who committed
suicide in 01936, who was the lover Emma Goldman’s, who died in 01940,
written after he was deported to Russia, following Goldman’s <em>My
Disillusionment in Russia</em> and <em>My Further Disillusionment in Russia</em>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1924_non-fiction_books">01924 gave us</a> Haldane’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daedalus;_or,_Science_and_the_Future"><em>Daedalus</em></a>; Crookshank’s virulent
pseudoscientific racist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mongol_in_Our_Midst"><em>The Mongol in our Midst</em></a>; and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessons_of_October"><em>Lessons of October</em></a> and <em>New Course</em> by Trotsky, assassinated
01940.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1923_non-fiction_books">01923 gave us</a> Santayana’s epistemological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scepticism_and_Animal_Faith">Scepticism
and Animal Faith</a>, Henry Smith Williams’s ten-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Modern_Science">Story of
Modern Science</a>, the first two volumes of Churchill’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Crisis">World
Crisis</a>, Bernays’s <em>Crystallizing Public Opinion</em>, and Jepson’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jepson_Manual">Manual of the Flowering Plants of California</a>.</p>
<p>01922 gave us <a href="https://archive.org/details/HandbookOfChemicalEngineeringI">Liddell’s <em>Handbook of Chemical Engineering</em></a> and
Born’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/einsteinstheoryo00born">_Einstein’s theory of relativity</a>.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells was English, mostly published first in England, and died in
01946, so his works have mostly been in the public domain since 02016,
since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries'_copyright_lengths">the UK sentences works to life + 70</a>; this notably includes
his 01919 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outline_of_History"><em>Outline of History</em></a>, which rejects racism.  In 01924
Wells published <em>A Year of Prophesying</em>, a compilation of his
columns. <em>The Everlasting Man</em>, published in 01925, was by Chesterton,
who was also English, but who died in 01936; it is a rebuttal to
Wells’s <em>Outline</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain">The US doesn’t observe the rule of the shorter term</a> for works
published in 01926 to 01977 unless they were in the public domain in
their source country on 01996-01-01, so I think Wells’s post-01925
works are not yet free in the US, but Chesterton’s are.  (Churchill
and Eliot didn't die until 01965.)<br />

  unchanged reprintings up to 01957; Irma S. Rombauer died in 01962,
  but her daughter Marion Rombauer Becker didn’t die until 01976.  So
  the original editions are public domain in countries observing the
  rule of the shorter term, but not those that sentence foreign works
  to life + 70 years.</li>

  reprinting of 01921 first edition by Macmillan and Company.  I
  didn’t know Keynes had written a textbook on probability; on
  skimming, this seems to spend as much time on epistemology as on
  mathematical proofs.</li>

<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/LeonhariEuleriCommentationsAlgebraicae"><em>Leonhari Euleri, Opera Omnia (Opera Mathematica Volumen Septimum):
  Commentationes Algebraicae: Ad Theoriam Combinationum et
  Probabilitatum Pertinentes</em></a>, published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Gustave_du_Pasquier">Louis Gustave Du
  Pasquier, died 01957</a>, published 01922, 644 pp., evidently
  mostly in French, with French notes by L. G. D., including
  manuscripts published here for the first time; though some Latin is
  present.  I’m not sure whether Euler’s French is Euler’s or a
  translation by L. G. D.  This is the 7th volume of the <em>Complete
  Works of Leonhard Euler</em> (<em>Oeuvres complètes de Léonard Euler</em>).
  The scan is not very good because it’s by Akce-Universal Digital
  Library, but it’s not totally fucked up like their other scans.
  L. G. D. taught at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland.  I’m
  not sure where this was published but I’m pretty sure it wasn’t the
  US, so it’s probably not in the public domain elsewhere.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/selectedstoriesf00henr"><em>Selected stories from O. Henry</em></a>, died 01910, including <em>The
  Gift of the Magi</em> (first published 01905), edited by his friend
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Alphonso_Smith">C. Alphonso Smith</a>, “late head of the Department of English at
  the United States Naval Academy”, died 01924, published by the
  Odyssey Press, New York, in 01922.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/storyoflittleblabanner"><em>The Story of Little Black Sambo</em></a>, by Helen Bannerman (died
  01946), published in New York in 01923 by the Frederick A. Stokes
  Company, following a London publication in 01899.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Little_Black_Sambo">Frequently
  criticized for racism</a>, the story itself contains no racist
  stereotypes, but the illustrations do; <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/sambo#etymonline_v_22666">around World War II</a> the
  name Sambo became a byword for racism, though perhaps originally it
  derives from Foulah <em>sambo</em> “uncle” or Hausa <em>sambo</em> “second son”.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/practicalchemist00newe">Lyman Churchill Newell’s 01922 extremely basic introductory
  textbook for children</a>, with exercises; originally published by
  D. C. Heath &amp; Co. (Boston, New York, Chicago), and he died in 01933.
  Scanned in color at 500 dpi, with 215 or so grayscale photographs
  and other figures.  The 560-page PDF is compressed very badly,
  inflicting fatal damage on most of the hundreds of photographs and
  other illustrations, but the original JP2 files are available and
  are not so corrupted.  Organic is relegated to “fuels and
  illuminants”, “other carbon compounds” and “food”, pp. 260-315,
  which I suppose in part represented the state of knowledge at the
  time.  Imperial units are used throughout except for temperature.
  “The topics suggested by the College Entrance Examination Board and
  the Board of Regents (New York) have been incorporated.”  The low
  information content of this book is hard to overstate; Gibbs free
  energy is not mentioned, and the notion of equilibrium is relegated
  to p. 152.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/details/erasmusinpraiseo00erasiala">In Praise of Folly</a>, by Desiderius Erasmus, in which he
  castigates royalty and the Church, published in New York by Peter
  Eckler Publishing Co. in 01922, with numerous engraved illustrations
  by Hans Holbein.  Peter Eckler himself wrote the preface, which is
  followed by a brief biography of Erasmus, who died in 01536.  The
  book seems to be printed entirely in English, but the biography and
  translation are uncredited.  Erasmus did presumably speak English,
  as he lived in England from 01510 to 01515, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Folly#/media/File:HolbeinErasmusFollymarginalia.jpg">the first edition
  was published in Latin and Greek</a> (<a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Moriae_encomium">mostly Latin</a>), with
  engravings by Holbein, who evidently died in 01543.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Lilacs_Last_in_the_Dooryard_Bloom'd#Publication_history">Eckler had
  previously published Walt Whitman’s <em>Drum-Taps</em> in 01865</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30132"><em>The Canon of the Bible</em> in 01877</a>, so he must have been very
  old by 01922!  My best guess is that Eckler was reprinting an
  earlier English translation, but not <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Praise_of_Folly/The_Praise_of_Folly">John Wilson’s 01668
  translation</a>, which is notably different and worse.</li>
