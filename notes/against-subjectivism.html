(36 minutes)</div><p>XXX note that fallibility is mentioned in the fallibility section and
also the section on people confusing social constructions with real
things</p>
<p>In a discussion recently, I saw someone say (slightly edited for
readability and formatting):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The</em> truth?  Engage in discussion in a productive way?  These
really don’t seem to be my things. ...  I’m not interested in
discussing things with people who believe in <em>the</em> truth (or that
they <em>know</em> it).  ... In my opinion, truth is being <em>established</em>
between people, within communities.  Truth is not a given, it does
not exist outside of a social context and it certainly does not
inhabit any discussion before common ground is found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to emphasize that this is not a straw man; it is a literal
transcript of something that someone actually said to me, improbable
as it sounds.  Therefore I think it is worthwhile to clearly explain
why it is untrue.</p>
<p>It struck me as a particularly clear statement of a malignant
doctrine, a collective variant of metaphysical solipsism, that I’ve
often seen in a more covert form.  It’s a hopelessly confused
metaphysical doctrine which eliminates both the possibility of
rational action and the possibility of any basis for agreement, other
than submission or compromise; scholars call it “<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/">global alethic
relativism</a>”.</p>
<h2>The truth in global alethic relativism</h2>
<p>First, though, let me explain what is <em>true</em> about this view.</p>
<h3>People cannot distinguish social constructions from objective truth</h3>
<p>There are <em>many</em> statements that people commonly accept as “true” that
are in fact socially constructed rather than objectively true in any
sense: my property extends up to such-and-such a line; masturbating in
public is unacceptable; <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> is not yet out of
copyright; saying that someone is “nice” is saying that they treat
others well.  Clearly the community could change its collective mind
about where the property line is drawn, what sorts of behavior are
acceptable and unacceptable, what causes bizarre human behaviors, the
terms of copyright, and the definitions of words.</p>
<p>People nearly always act as if things like national boundaries,
corporations, ghosts, demonic possessions, marriages, and land tenure
rights <em>exist</em> in the same objective, material sense that stone walls
or puppies do.  This is very practically useful: you cannot run
through a stone wall by disbelieving in it, and in the same way you
cannot run through a heavily armed international border by
disbelieving in it — even though the border is socially constructed,
the armaments and the border guards wielding them are objectively,
materially real.</p>
<p>But, in fact, when it comes to such things, there is indeed no such
thing as <em>the</em> truth; the truth of a marriage, a corporation, a
national border, or a law is established between people, within
communities.  It does not exist outside of a social context and does
not “inhabit any discussion before common ground is found.”  It is a
shared opinion, not a fact about the material world.</p>
<p>The relevant difference is that if <em>the border guards</em> stop
believing in the national boundary, or can be tricked about where it
is, then you can cross it without changing anything in the material
world other than people’s beliefs and expectations.  This does not
work with stone walls.</p>
<h3>People are fallible</h3>
<p>Everyone has had the experience of being wrong about things, and
dialogue with other people is usually the way we find out we are
wrong — in cases like land tenure rights and national boundaries,
<em>some</em> sort of communication with other people is the <em>only</em> way to
find out, because those things don’t physically exist in the material
world, except as beliefs in people’s minds.  Everyone has also had the
experience of encountering someone who is unwilling to consider the
possibility that they are wrong.</p>
<p>Everyone has also had the experience of having beliefs that they
<em>thought</em> were objective truth, which turned out to only be
opinions — usually because they met someone with different opinions.</p>
<p>Given this background of experience, how can we justify any belief
at all in <em>the</em> truth, or a truth that exists outside of any social
context?  How do we know that we aren’t just confusing ourselves
again, switching from one set of beliefs to a more popular one,
without ever making any contact with objective reality?</p>
<h3>People’s understanding of the objective world is filtered through social constructions</h3>
<p>A different aspect of this proposition is that people are not mentally
equipped to grapple directly with the immense mass of brute facts in
the objective world, so they retreat to what <a href="https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6456/pg6456.html" title="Public Opinion, 01922">Walter Lippmann terms
“fictions”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its
interests and so small that everyone can know all about everything
that happens, ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard
to grasp. Miss Sherwin of Gopher Prairie is aware that a war is
raging in France and tries to conceive it. She has never been to
France, and certainly she has never been along what is now the
battlefront.</p>
<p>Pictures of French and German soldiers she has seen, but it is
impossible for her to imagine three million men. No one, in fact,
can imagine them, and the professionals do not try. They think of
them as, say, two hundred divisions. But Miss Sherwin has no access
to the order of battle maps, and so if she is to think about the
war, she fastens upon Joffre and the Kaiser as if they were engaged
in a personal duel. Perhaps if you could see what she sees with her
mind’s eye, the image in its composition might be not unlike an
Eighteenth Century engraving of a great soldier. He stands there
boldly unruffled and more than life size, with a shadowy army of
tiny little figures winding off into the landscape behind.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In all these instances we must note particularly one common
factor. It is the insertion between man and his environment of a
pseudo-environment. To that pseudo-environment his behavior is a
response. But because it is behavior, the consequences, if they are
acts, operate not in the pseudo-environment where the behavior is
stimulated, but in the real environment where action eventuates. If
the behavior is not a practical act, but what we call roughly
thought and emotion, it may be a long time before there is any
noticeable break in the texture of the fictitious world. But when
the stimulus of the pseudo-fact results in action on things or other
people, contradiction soon develops. Then comes the sensation of
butting one’s head against a stone wall, of learning by experience,
and witnessing Herbert Spencer’s tragedy of the murder of a
Beautiful Theory by a Gang of Brutal Facts, the discomfort in short
of a maladjustment. For certainly, at the level of social life, what
is called the adjustment of man to his environment takes place
through the medium of fictions.</p>
<p>By fictions I do not mean lies. I mean a representation of the
environment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man
himself. The range of fiction extends all the way from complete
hallucination to the scientists’ perfectly self-conscious use of a
schematic model, or his decision that for his particular problem
accuracy beyond a certain number of decimal places is not
important. A work of fiction may have almost any degree of fidelity,
and so long as the degree of fidelity can be taken into account,
fiction is not misleading. In fact, human culture is very largely
the selection, the rearrangement, the tracing of patterns upon, and
the stylizing of, what William James called “the random irradiations
and resettlements of our ideas.” [Footnote: James, Principles of
Psychology, Vol. II, p. 638] The alternative to the use of fictions
is direct exposure to the ebb and flow of sensation. That is not a
real alternative, for however refreshing it is to see at times with
a perfectly innocent eye, innocence itself is not wisdom, though a
source and corrective of wisdom. For the real environment is
altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct
acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety, so
much variety, so many permutations and combinations. And although we
have to act in that environment, we have to reconstruct it on a
simpler model before we can manage with it. To traverse the world
men must have maps of the world. Their persistent difficulty is to
secure maps on which their own need, or someone else’s need, has not
sketched in the coast of Bohemia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these “fictions” or “pseudo-environments” are products of social
contexts and evolve from the interplay and negotiation between people.
Lippmann’s “fictions”, however, have “degrees of fidelity”: they are
referred to an underlying environment, and may be better or worse at
it, so they can be more or less true in ways that have nothing to do
with social consensus.</p>
<h2>Why alethic relativism is false</h2>
<p>But this extremist form of relativism does not stop at pointing out
that people commonly accept social constructions as facts, are
fallible, and understand their environment in a way that is profoundly
altered and simplified by their social context; it calls into question
even propositions such as whether there is a stone wall in front of
you, the commutativity of integer multiplication, or whether Elvis
Presley is still alive.</p>
<h3>The obvious problem is that it affirms nonsense</h3>
<p>At first glance it would seem to foreclose only the possibility of any
basis for agreement other than mere popularity.  It entails that
geocentrism was actually true until Copernicus and Galileo made it
unpopular, and heliocentrism was false, because the community of the
Catholic Church had established the truth of geocentrism.  It argues
that whether there is or is not a stone wall in front of you is a
truth that can only exist inside of a social context, established
between people, within communities; the right social context would
allow you to run through the stone wall as easily as you can run
across a state line in the US.  It entails that exterminating sparrows
and deep plowing in the Great Leap Forward was to result in abundance
rather than famine, because the social context had established that it
would.  It asserts that the only difference between truth and lies is
that people disbelieve lies.</p>
<p>That is, it cannot distinguish between truth and collective ignorance
or self-delusion.</p>
<h3>Worse, it can’t even agree on which nonsense to affirm in which context</h3>
<p>But, in fact, the problem goes much deeper!  According to this radical
form of relativism, it isn’t even objectively true that the Catholic
Church was preaching geocentrism, or that the Inquisition put Galileo
under house arrest for teaching heliocentrism, or for that matter that
our own community subscribes to heliocentrism.  If saying that some
proposition <em>X</em> is true means only that some community has accepted
<em>X</em> as true, then it would be equally valid for the following “truths”
to “exist” by “being established” within a different community or
social context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Catholic Church was teaching heliocentrism and Galileo, who was
never put under house arrest, was teaching geocentrism.  Nowadays
most people accept geocentrism.  The Great Leap Forward did not
promote exterminating sparrows or deep plowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, the question of what a given community establishes, or
established, as truth, is itself a question of objective fact, so
relativists are in some sense smuggling in a hidden dependency on</p>
<h3>Alethic relativism contradicts itself when we look at what people believe</h3>
<p>In an ontological sense, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#AleRelChaSelRef" title="Alethic Relativism and the charge of self-refutation.">this is incoherent</a>, in a way
shown by Plato; the SEP summarizes his argument as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people believe that Protagoras’s doctrine is false.<br />
Protagoras, on the other hand, believes his doctrine to be true.<br />
By his own doctrine, Protagoras must believe that his opponents’
view is true.<br />
Therefore, Protagoras must believe that his own doctrine is false.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plato’s version of this argument is considerably lengthier and is
quoted in full at the end of this note; as the SEP notes, though, this
argument begs the question, implicitly relying on a notion of absolute
rather than relative truth.  Protagoras must believe that his
opponents’ view is true <em>for them</em>.</p>
<p>This argument is contingent on what the actual social consensus is;
in a world where everyone agreed with Protagoras, it would lose its
force.  Nevertheless, we do not live in such a world.  People
routinely make factual assertions based on an evident belief that some
statements are true and others are false in a fashion that is
independent of people’s opinions.</p>
<h3>And it makes predictions very much at odds with reality</h3>
<p><a href="http://fcaglp.fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar/~sixto/borges/ficciones/jardin/tlon.htm">Borges, in <em>Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius</em></a> writes (my translation
below):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Siglos y siglos de idealismo no han dejado de influir en la
realidad.  No es infrecuente, en las regiones más antiguas de Tlön,
la duplicación de objetos perdidos.  Dos personas buscan un lápiz;
la primera lo encuentra y no dice nada; la segunda encuentra un
segundo lápiz no menos real, pero más ajustado a su expectativa.
Esos objetos secundarios se llaman <em>hrönir</em> y son, aunque de forma
desairada, un poco más largos.  Hasta hace poco los <em>hrönir</em> fueron
hijos casuales de la distracción y el olvido. Parece mentira que su
metódica producción cuente apenas cien años, pero así lo declara el
Onceno Tomo.  Los primeros intentos fueron estériles.  El <em>modus
operandi</em>, sin embargo, merece recordación.  El director de una de
las cárceles del estado comunicó a los presos que en el antiguo
lecho de un río había ciertos sepulcros y prometió la libertad a
quienes trajeran un hallazgo importante.  Durante los meses que
precedieron a la excavación les mostraron láminas fotográficas de lo
que iban a hallar.  Ese primer intento probó que la esperanza y la
avidez pueden inhibir; una semana de trabajo con la pala y el pico
no logró exhumar otro <em>hrön</em> que una rueda herrumbrada, de fecha
posterior al experimento.  Éste se mantuvo secreto y se repitió
después en cuatro colegios.  En tres fue casi total el fracaso; en
el cuarto (cuyo director murió casualmente durante las primeras
excavaciones) los discípulos exhumaron —o produjeron— una máscara de
oro, una espada arcaica, dos o tres ánforas de barro y el verdinoso
y mutilado torso de un rey con una inscripción en el pecho que no se
ha logrado aún descifrar.  Así se descubrió la improcedencia de
testigos que conocieran la naturaleza experimental de la busca...
Las investigaciones en masa producen objetos contradictorios; ahora
se prefiere los trabajos individuales y casi improvisados.  La
metódica elaboración de <em>hrönir</em> (dice el Onceno Tomo) ha prestado
servicios prodigiosos a los arqueólogos.  Ha permitido interrogar y
hasta modificar el pasado, que ahora no es menos plástico y menos
dócil que el porvenir.  Hecho curioso: los <em>hrönir</em> de segundo y de
tercer grado —los <em>hrönir</em> derivados de otro <em>hrön</em>, los <em>hrönir</em>
derivados del <em>hrön</em> de un <em>hrön</em>— exageran las aberraciones del
inicial; los de quinto son casi uniformes; los de noveno se
confunden con los de segundo; en los de undécimo hay una pureza de
líneas que los originales no tienen.  El proceso es periódico: el
<em>hrön</em> de duodécimo grado ya empieza a decaer.  Más extraño y más
puro que todo <em>hrön</em> es a veces el <em>ur</em>, la cosa producida por
sugestión, el objeto educido por la esperanza.  La gran máscara de
oro que he mencionado es un ilustre ejemplo.</p>
<p>Centuries and centuries of idealism have not ceased to influence
reality.  Not infrequently, in the oldest regions of Tlön, lost
objects are duplicated.  Two people seek a pencil; the first finds
it and says nothing; the second finds a second pencil no less real,
but more in keeping with their expectations.  These secondary
objects are called <em>hrönir</em> and are, though only slightly, somewhat
longer.  Until recently the <em>hrönir</em> were accidental children of
distraction and forgetfulness.  Incredibly, their methodical
production is only a hundred years old, so the Eleventh Volume says.
The first attempts were fruitless.  The <em>modus operandi</em>, however,
is worthy of note.  The director of one of the state prisons told
the prisoners that in the riverbed were certain sepulchres,
promising liberty to whoever should bring him a significant find.
During the months preceding the excavation, they were shown
photographic slides of what they were to find.  This first attempt
showed that hope and greed can inhibit; a week of labor with shovels
and picks failed to exhume any <em>hrön</em> but a rusty wheel, of a date
later than the experiment.  This was kept secret and repeated in
four workshops.  In three the failure was nearly total; in the
fourth (whose director died coincidentally during the first
excavations) the disciples exhumed — or produced — a golden mask, an
archaic sword, two or three amphoras of mud, and the greenish and
mutilated torso of a king with a still undeciphered inscription on
his chest.  Thus they discovered the uselessness of witnesses who
understood the experimental nature of the search...  Mass research
produces contradictory objects; now preference is given to
individual and almost improvisational experiments.  The methodical
production of <em>hrönir</em> (says the Eleventh Volume) has provided
prodigious benefits to archaeologists.  It has permitted the
interrogation and even modification of the past, which is now no
less flexible and docile than the future.  Curious fact: the
<em>hrönir</em> of second and third degree — the <em>hrönir</em> derived from
another <em>hrön</em> — exaggerate the aberrations of the first; those of
the fifth degree are almost uniform; those of the ninth degree are
confused with those of the second; in those of the eleventh there is
a purity of line that the originals lack.  The process is periodic:
the <em>hrön</em> of twelfth degree begins to decay.  Stranger and purer
than any <em>hrön</em> is, at times, the <em>ur</em>, the thing produced by
suggestion, the object educed by hope.  The great mask of gold I
have mentioned is an illustrious example.</p>

<p>Along the same satirical lines, Douglas Adams writes, in <em>Life, the
Universe, and Everything</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Recreational Impossibilities” was a heading which caught Trillian’s
eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through the
Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable speeds in
an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something
undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser and read about how
to fly.</p>
<p>The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject
of flying.</p>
<p>There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying.</p>
<p>The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and
miss.</p>
<p>Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.</p>
<p>The first part is easy.</p>
<p>All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with
all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it’s going to
hurt.</p>
<p>That is, it’s going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.</p>
<p>Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying
properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly
hard.</p>
<p>Clearly, it’s the second point, the missing, which presents the
difficulties.</p>
<p>One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It’s
no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you
won’t. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by
something else when you’re halfway there, so that you are no longer
thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it’s
going to hurt if you fail to miss it.</p>
<p>It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these
three things during the split second you have at your
disposal. Hence most people’s failure, and their eventual
disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.</p>
<p>If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily
distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs
(tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phylum and/or personal
inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly
spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby
twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely
and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to
be a slightly foolish manner.</p>
<p>This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.</p>
<p>Bob and float, float and bob.</p>
<p>Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself
waft higher.</p>
<p>Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they
are unlikely to say anything helpful.</p>
<p>They are most likely to say something along the lines of, “Good God,
you can’t possibly be flying!”</p>
<p>It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be
right.</p>
<p>Waft higher and higher.</p>
<p>Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the
treetops breathing regularly.</p>
<p>Do not wave at anybody.</p>
<p>When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.</p>
<p>You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your
flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies
in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just
allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway.</p>
<p>You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you
will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first
attempt.</p>
<p>There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve
the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people with
surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and
exhibit and/or explain them at the crucial moments. Few genuine
hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may
be able to get temporary employment at them.</p>
<p>Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod
wasn’t really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or
for walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan
Civil Service to acknowledge a change-of-address card, which were
the other things listed under the heading “Recreational
Impossibilities”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such Wile E. Coyote techniques do not work in our world,
individually or in groups, so we can conclude that alethic relativism
is false; that there exists a truth, an objective reality, independent
of our communities, outside of a social context, even before common
ground is found.</p>
<p>Of course, this too begs the question — it relies on the presumption
that it is <em>objectively true</em> that such events do not happen in our
world, while a relativist might argue that <em>for us</em> they do not
happen, while <em>for them</em> such events <em>do</em> happen.  I have not yet met
a relativist who has dared to make such an argument, but in this way
alethic relativism could insulate itself from all possible disproof,
just as ordinary solipsism does.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism">the Wikipedia article on social constructionism complains</a>,
“It has been objected that strong social constructionism undermines
the foundation of science as the pursuit of objectivity and, as a
theory, defies any attempt at falsifying it.”</p>
<h2>Alethic relativism is malignant because it would render science, engineering, and the rest of philosophy impossible</h2>
<p>So what?  Why is it worth talking about?  Many people believe many
false and incoherent things, but we don’t spend all our time
constructing detailed refutations of each of them.  What makes this
doctrine so “malignant” it’s worth our attention?</p>
<p>I have two major concerns with this sort of willful blindness to
objective reality, which accepts popularity contests as superior to
empirical evidence or logical reasoning: it is guaranteed to render
disagreements unresolvable, and it makes rational action impossible.
It’s a collective variant of solipsism in the sense that, rather than
proposing that <em>I</em> am alone in the universe, it proposes that <em>we</em> are
alone in the universe; every other fact is taken to be merely a social
consensus, only “true” relative to the community that established it,
possibly “false” relative to other communities.  By deluding its
adherents into rejecting the universe, it tempts them to “establish
truths” by collective partisan violence rather than by logic and
evidence, violence that ultimately ends in self-destruction.</p>
<p>As Borges writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Este monismo o idealismo total invalida la ciencia. Explicar (o
juzgar) un hecho es unirlo a otro; esa vinculación, en Tlön, es un
estado posterior del sujeto, que no puede afectar o iluminar el
estado anterior. Todo estado mental es irreductible: el mero hecho
de nombrarlo -<em>id est</em>, de clasificarlo- importa un falseo. De ello
cabría deducir que no hay ciencias en Tlön -ni siquiera
razonamientos. La paradójica verdad es que existen, en casi
innumerable número. ... El hecho de que toda filosofía sea de
antemano un juego dialéctico, una <em>Philosophie des Als Ob</em>, ha
contribuido a multiplicarlas. Abundan los sistemas increíbles, pero
de arquitectura agradable o de tipo sensacional. Los metafísicos de
Tlön no buscan la verdad ni siquiera la verosimilitud: buscan el
asombro. Juzgan que la metafísica es una rama de la literatura
fantástica.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This monism or total idealism invalidates science.  Explaining (or
judging) a fact is uniting it to another; this linking, in Tlön, is
a posterior state of the subject, which cannot affect or illuminate
its prior state.  Every mental state is irreducible: the mere fact
of naming it — that is, of classifying it — imports a falsehood.
From this one could deduce that there are no sciences in Tlön — not
even reasoning.  The paradoxical truth is that they do exist, in an
almost uncountable number. ... The fact that all philosophy is from
the beginning a dialectical game, a <em>Philosophie des Als Ob</em>, has
contributed to multiplying them.  Incredible systems abound, but of
agreeable architecture or of a sensational type.  The metaphysicians
of Tlön do not seek the truth or even plausibility: they seek
surprise.  They consider metaphysics to be a branch of fantasy
literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, people commonly disagree on empirical questions like
whether Elvis Presley is still alive or not, as well as logical or
mathematical questions like whether it is true that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture">every even whole
number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers</a>, for
example due to access to differing evidence or due to limitations in
their reasoning.</p>
<p>And people commonly differ in their interpretation of language; one
person may interpret a sentence as a proposition that is true, while
another interprets it as a diiferent proposition that is false.  For example,
the sentence “every even whole number is the sum of two prime numbers”
depends on the definition of “prime number”; it is trivially false
according to our modern definition (in which 1 is not a prime number),
because 2 is a example, but when Euler originally stated Goldbach’s
conjecture, he stated it that way because he was using a definition of
“prime numbers” (or rather, “prīmī”, using a Latin word) that included
1 as a “prime”.  Thus our interpretation of a sentence, for example in
English, German, or Latin, depends on the socially constructed
meanings of the words in it.  (“Nice” used to mean “insignificant”,
too.)</p>
<p>But these sorts of disagreement presuppose the existence of an
objective reality that could, in principle, resolve them.  Alethic
relativism, by contrast, claims that it is merely a matter of social
consensus — opinion — whether Elvis is alive or dead, or
whether 2 + 2 = 4.  It claims that there is no objective sense in
which Elvis is dead or alive, or in which 2 + 2 = 4, so there is no
point in talking about it except to establish social consensus.</p>

version I quoted above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Let us then get the agreement in as concise a form as
possible, not through others, but from his [Protagoras’s] own
statement.</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> How?</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> In this way: He says, does he not? “that which appears
to each person really is to him to whom it appears.”</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Yes, that is what he says.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Well then, Protagoras, we also utter the opinions of a
man, or rather, of all men, and we say that there is no one who does
not think himself wiser than others in some respects and others
wiser than himself in other respects; for instance, in times of
greatest danger, when people are distressed in war or by diseases or
at sea, they regard their commanders as gods and expect them to be
their saviors, though they excel them in nothing except
knowledge. And all the world of men is, I dare say, full of people
seeking teachers and rulers for themselves and the animals and for
human activities, and, on the other hand, of people who consider
themselves qualified to teach and qualified to rule. And in all
these instances we must say that men themselves believe that wisdom
and ignorance exist in the world of men, must we not?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Yes, we must.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> And therefore they think that wisdom is true thinking
and ignorance false opinion, do they not?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Well then, Protagoras, what shall we do about the
doctrine? Shall we say that the opinions which men have are always
true, or sometimes true and sometimes false? For the result of
either statement is that their opinions are not always true, but may
be either true or false. Just think, Theodorus, would any follower
of Protagoras, or you yourself care to contend that no person thinks
that another is ignorant and has false opinions?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> No, that is incredible, Socrates. </p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> And yet this is the predicament to which the doctrine
that man is the measure of all things inevitably leads.</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> How so?</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> When you have come to a decision in your own mind about
something, and declare your opinion to me, this opinion is,
according to his doctrine, true to you; let us grant that; but may
not the rest of us sit in judgement on your decision, or do we
always judge that your opinion is true? Do not myriads of men on
each occasion oppose their opinions to yours, believing that your
judgement and belief are false?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Yes, by Zeus, Socrates, countless myriads in truth, as
Homer says, and they give me all the trouble in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Well then, shall we say that in such a case your
opinion is true to you but false to the myriads?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> That seems to be the inevitable deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> And what of Protagoras himself? If neither he himself
thought, nor people in general think, as indeed they do not, that
man is the measure of all things, is it not inevitable that the
“truth” which he wrote is true to no one? But if he himself thought
it was true, and people in general do not agree with him, in the
first place you know that it is just so much more false than true as
the number of those who do not believe it is greater than the number
of those who do.</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Necessarily, if it is to be true or false according to
each individual opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Secondly, it involves this, which is a very pretty
result; he concedes about his own opinion the truth of the opinion
of those who disagree with him and think that his opinion is false,
since he grants that the opinions of all men are true.</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Then would he not be conceding that his own opinion is
false, if he grants that the opinion of those who think he is in
error is true?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> But the others do not concede that they are in error,
do they?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> No, they do not.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> And he, in turn, according to his writings, grants that
this opinion also is true.</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Evidently.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Then all men, beginning with Protagoras, will
dispute—or rather, he will grant, after he once concedes that the
opinion of the man who holds the opposite view is true—even
Protagoras himself, I say, will concede that neither a dog nor any
casual man is a measure of anything whatsoever that he has not
learned. Is not that the case?</p>
<p><strong>Theodorus</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong> Then since the “truth” of Protagoras is disputed by
all, it would be true to nobody, neither to anyone else nor to him.</p>
