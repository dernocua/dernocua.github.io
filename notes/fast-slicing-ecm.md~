Electrochemical machining can remove material at a speed limited by
the area of the interelectrode process gap, assuming adequate
flushing.  That is, with the same current density distributed over
twice as much electrode area, you can remove twice the volume of
material per unit time.

If you want to slice a block of metal in half, one way to do this is
to use a wire electrode, which can cut a plane one line at a time.
But if you instead use an electrode in the shape of a saw blade, with
electrical insulation everywhere except the edge, the electrode
surface area is potentially many times larger, and so you can
potentially cut much faster.

Taken to the extreme, this logic suggests using a long line of needles
or teeth, a few times wider than the process gap, as the cutting
cathode.
