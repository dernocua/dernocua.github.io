In a discussion recently, I saw someone say (somewhat edited for readability):

> *The* truth?  Engage in discussion in a productive way?  These
> really don't seem to be my things.  I'm not interested in discussing
> things with people who believe in *the* truth (or that they *know*
> it).


15:23 < muurkha> "imo truth is being /established/ between people, within communities. truth is not a given, it does not exist outside 
                 of a social context and it certainly does not inhabit any discussion before common ground is found." is a collective 
                 variant of metaphysical solipsism.  it's a hopelessly confused philosophical doctrine which forecloses the possibility 
                 of any basis for agreement

15:26 < muurkha> at first glance it would seem to foreclose only the possibility of any basis for agreement other than mere popularity, 
                 implying that, for example, geocentrism was actually true before Copernicus and Galileo made it unpopular, and 
                 heliocentrism was false, because the community of the Catholic Church had established the truth of geocentrism
15:32 < muurkha> but in fact the problem goes deeper, because according to this radical form of relativism, it isn't even objectively 
                 true that the Catholic Church was preaching geocentrism, or that the Inquisition put Galileo under house arrest for 
                 teaching heliocentrism, or for that matter that our own community subscribes to heliocentrism.  if saying that some 
                 proposition X is true means only that some 
15:32 < muurkha> community has accepted X as true, then it is equally valid to say that the Catholic Church was teaching heliocentrism 
                 and Galileo, who was never put under house arrest, was teaching geocentrism
15:33 < muurkha> that is, it would be equally valid for that "truth" to "exist" in a different community or social context
15:38 < muurkha> from my point of view that sort of willful blindness to objective reality, accepting popularity contests as superior to 
                 empirical evidence, is guaranteed to render disagreements unresolvable
15:39 < muurkha> that said, it was wrong of me to let *my* emotions leap to anger and to insult gbrlwck by saying "shh.  the adults are 
                 talking," and I'm sorry I did that
