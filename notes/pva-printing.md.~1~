Because polyvinyl alcohol can be (ionically) crosslinked with borate
to gel, forming a much less water-soluble polymer (though still a
thermoplastic), I think you could do a useful 3-D printing system by
extruding a solution of polyvinyl alcohol in water, spraying the
surface with a solution of borax or boric acid in between
