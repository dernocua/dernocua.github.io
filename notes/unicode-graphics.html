(9 minutes)</div><p>There are a variety of Unicode graphics drawing character sets,
similar to the <a href="https://www.curiousmarc.com/computing/hp-264x-terminals">Large Character Microvector Set ROM from the HP 2640
series</a>, which let you draw each character from a “3×3 matrix of
smaller characters”.</p>
<p>I was thinking it might be fun to abuse some of these character sets
for asciinema plotting and the like.</p>
<h2>Unicode math character pieces</h2>
<p>These are used to build up large math symbols over several character
cells.  I don’t know where they come from but I suspect they’re in
Unicode for round-tripping compatibility.</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x239b to #x23b3 do (insert i))</p>
<pre><code>⎛⎜⎝⎞⎟⎠⎡⎢⎣⎤⎥⎦⎧⎨⎩⎪⎫⎬⎭⎮⎯
</code></pre>
<p>You can use them like this:</p>
<pre><code>⎛    ⎞ ⎡  ⎤ ⎧    ⎫           ⎰ ⎱ 
⎜⎛  ⎞⎟ ⎢  ⎥ ⎪    ⎪  ⎧        ⎱ ⎰ 
⎜⎜()⎟⎟ ⎣  ⎦ ⎨    ⎬  ⎮ x² dx      
⎜⎝  ⎠⎟      ⎪    ⎪  ⎭        ⎲   
⎝    ⎠      ⎩    ⎭           ⎳
</code></pre>
<h2>Box drawings</h2>
<p>This is the set from U+2500 to U+257F from Videotex mosaic characters:</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x2500 to #x257f do (insert i))</p>
<pre><code>─━│┃┄┅┆┇┈┉┊┋┌┍┎┏┐┑┒┓└┕┖┗┘┙┚┛├┝┞┟
┠┡┢┣┤┥┦┧┨┩┪┫┬┭┮┯┰┱┲┳┴┵┶┷┸┹┺┻┼┽┾┿
╀╁╂╃╄╅╆╇╈╉╊╋╌╍╎╏═║╒╓╔╕╖╗╘╙╚╛╜╝╞╟
╠╡╢╣╤╥╦╧╨╩╪╫╬╭╮╯╰╱╲╳╴╵╶╷╸╹╺╻╼╽╾╿
</code></pre>
<p>This contains light, heavy, and double line weights in horizontal and
vertical orientations, though not all combinations of these, plus
double, triple, and quadruple-dashed variants of light and heavy
straight lines, plus light diagonals, plus rounded corners.  With
these you can do arbitrary combinations of vertical and horizontal
lines in half-character-cell increments.  I think all the combinations
of light and heavy lines are provided; that would be 3⁴ = 81
characters, which are the ones from U+2500 to U+254B inclusive except
U+2504 to U+250B inclusive, plus the ones from U+2574 to U+257F: (+ (-
(- #x254C #x2500) (- #x250c #x2504)) (- #x2580 #x2574)) gives 80, so
either I miscounted or one is missing.  All three combinations of
diagonal lines are provided, but most of the light–double combinations
and all of the heavy–double combinations are missing.</p>
<p>So with these Videotex characters you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><code>╭──────┒   ╲╳╱   ╱╲     ╔══════╗
│      ┃          ╱╲    ╟──────╢
┕━━━━━━┛         ╱╲     ║      ║
                        ╚══════╝
</code></pre>
<h2>Quadrant characters</h2>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2018/18235-terminals-prop.pdf">a 2018 “Graphics for Legacy Computing” proposal to add 64
sextant characters to Unicode starting at U+1FB00</a> compatible with
the TRS-80 “pseudopixel” or “semigraphics” set, or teletext systems
including Minitel.  But since 1991 Unicode has contained “quadrant”
characters, like the Sinclair ZX-80 and ZX-81 or the Commodore line,
with <em>four</em> pseudopixels per character cell, from U+2596 to U+259F:</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x2596 to #x259f do (insert i))</p>
<pre><code>▖▗▘▙▚▛▜▝▞▟
</code></pre>
<p>This is visibly missing the all-empty and all-full configurations (■,
which follows them, is not the all-full configuration), but normally a
space can be used with or without inverse video.</p>
<p>For monochrome or 2-color graphics, these characters plus inverse
video permit doubling the character grid resolution, with full color
freedom.</p>
<h2>Eighth blocks and scan lines</h2>
<p>This is the set from U+2580 to U+2590, in “Blocks” (now “Block
Elements”):</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x2580 to #x2590 do (insert i))</p>
<pre><code>▀▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█▉▊▋▌▍▎▏▐
</code></pre>
<p>These characters allow you to divide character cells vertically or
horizontally (but not both) into two colors with a resolution of ⅛
cell.  They’re commonly used, for example, for plotting sparklines.
They are clearly designed for use with inverse video (^[[7m in ANSI).</p>
<p>This is particularly useful for bar plots, as provided by
<a href="https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl">UnicodePlots.jl</a>, where the blocks divided left to right can
provide 640 pixels of horizontal precision for your bars on an
80-character screen.  This includes stacked bars in which different
colors divide a bar horizontally and may include inline legends.
However, experimentation seems to show that my terminal here renders
them incorrectly, with some unfilled space above them in the character
cell:</p>
<pre><code>▊▋▌▍▎▏▐
▊▋▌▍▎▏▐
▊▋▌▍▎▏▐
</code></pre>
<p>Similar are the “horizontal scan line” characters, of which there are
only four starting at U+23BA:</p>
<pre><code>⎺⎻⎼⎽
</code></pre>
<p>These are explained in <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2000/00159-ucsterminal.txt">Frank da Cruz’s proposal L2/00-159</a> as
being for round-trip compatibility with some old terminals:</p>
<pre><code>  E0D6   Scan 1    DSG 06/15, H19 07/10, WG3 05/00, TVI 09/00, IBM SV300400
  E0D7   Scan 3    DSG 07/00, WYA 01/01, WG3 05/00, IBM SV300200
  E0D8   Scan 5    DSG 07/01, WYA 02/02, IBM SV300300, IBM SM920000
  E0D9   Scan 7    DSG 07/02, WYA 01/03, WG3 05/01, IBM SV300100
  E0DA   Scan 9    DSG 07/03, H19 07/11, WG3 05/01, TVI 09/01, IBM SV300600
</code></pre>
<p>They’re intended to join up with U+23B8 “⎸” and U+23B9 “⎹” to make
boxes in a similar way to the Videotex box-drawing characters above,
and there are supposed to be five of them, but this does not work in
my current font:</p>
<pre><code>⎹⎽⎸⎹⎺⎸⎹⎻⎸⎹⎼⎸
</code></pre>
<p>These can be used for sparklines in a similar way to the
vertically-divided eighth blocks, but with half the resolution.
Sometimes U+2500 is considered a part of the set, but at least in the
font I’m using at the moment, it doesn’t fit:</p>
<pre><code>⎺⎻─⎼⎽
</code></pre>
<p>The proposed “legacy computing” characters would augment these with,
among other things, 8-position horizontal and vertical lines.</p>
<h2>Edge box drawing</h2>
<p>As sort of noted above, the characters <code>⎹</code> U+23B9 and <code>⎺</code> U+23BA link
up:</p>
<pre><code>⎹⎺⎹⎺⎹⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
  ⎹⎺⎹⎺⎹⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
</code></pre>
<p>In my current font, successive rows of <code>⎹</code> don’t quite link up the way
they’re supposed to, but successive columns of <code>⎺</code> do.  From the
“eighth blocks” area we have another couple of characters (or actually
various pairs of characters) that can potentially be applied in the
same way:</p>
<pre><code>▁▏▁▁▏▁▁▏▁▁▏
▁▏▁▏▁▏▁▏▁▏
</code></pre>
<p>These also fail to link up from one line to the next in my current
font.</p>
<p>The aforementioned “Graphics for Legacy Computing” proposal includes
more such characters, including four corners intended to link up with
the above “eighth blocks”:</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x1fb7c to #x1fb7f do (insert i))</p>
<pre><code>🭼🭽🭾🭿
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, with three printable characters like this plus a space, you
could lay out a grid of thin lines with the resolution of the
character grid, with the lines beginning and ending at, say, the upper
left-hand corner of each character cell.  This would be potentially
more parsimonious than the box-drawing characters we <em>did</em> get, which
can end and join at the center of each character cell, but be
interrupted at half-character-cell intervals, a relatively useless
ability.  But for this ability we need 15 graphics characters (for a
single line width) rather than 3.</p>
<h2>Shade characters</h2>
<p>The three “shade” characters from U+2591 to U+2593 can be used to
dither between a foreground color and a background color; really you
only need two of them if you have inverse video or full liberty in
color choice:</p>
<pre><code>░▒▓
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn’t increase the resolution of your display any, though.</p>
<h2>Braille provides the best resolution, though not without drawbacks</h2>
<p>The Braille block from U+2800 to U+28FF offers a full selection of 256
binary patterns of 8 pixels:</p>
<p>(loop for i from #x2800 to #x28ff do (insert i))</p>

<p>At the expense of a little dottiness, background bleedthrough, and
spacing jitter, this can be used to get 8× character cell resolution
for things like plotting points and lines on a character display;
15360 pixels in a standard 80×24 terminal window.  This is better
resolution than even the proposed sextant characters, and the
pseudopixels are usually squarer.  The bit positions within the
character cell, with x increasing right and y increasing down, are (0,
0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3), in
that order.</p>
<p>For example, you can plot this circle:</p>

<p>(Some terminals display this suboptimally with the non-active Braille
dots also drawn, as empty circles.)</p>
<p>I did that with this simple Python program:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import division, print_function

<h2>Triangle characters</h2>
<p>These probably are <em>not</em> useful as mosaic characters like the ones in
the “Graphics for Legacy Computing” item above; faced with the choice
between making them mate properly for mosaicing and giving them 45°
angles, font designers have typically chosen the latter:</p>
