15:35 < xentrac> CloudEvil: hmm, what about the physical scaling laws?
15:35 < kludge> magic_ninja: If you are in the US:

15:35 < kludge> magic_ninja: and buy the step-up transformer from edcor.
15:35 < magic_ninja> we are recessing them
15:35 < CloudEvil> xentrac: That's part of the issue, pipe friction gets worse with size, as does length/area for piston rings and such.
15:35 < CloudEvil> xentrac: Contamination and surface finish start to matter enormously.
15:36 < xentrac> CloudEvil: is heat flow part of the problem?  I'd think you'd have more heat leakage at the 1-mm scale than at the 
                 100-mm scale
15:36 < CloudEvil> yes.
15:36 < kludge> magic_ninja: I don't know of any recessed ones that are waterproof... tannoy used to make some but they are gone, but 
                you can look on the parts express site.
15:37 < magic_ninja> kludge, it is a dry-area. A good 7' to 8' from edge. I'm comfortable putting non-rated speakers out there.
15:37 < kludge> magic_ninja: you can also add a 70V distribution transformer onto the back of an 8 ohm speaker.
15:37 < magic_ninja> lol just a second. I'm trying to get caught up with you here.
15:37 < xentrac> what you're saying about piston rings is that your displacement falls as f³, I guess?  how does the piston ring 
                 friction fall?
15:37 < magic_ninja> So, I won't be able to get the AVR with a built-in stepup
15:38 < kludge> magic_ninja: these are kind of beamy and not horrible:

15:38 < CloudEvil> xentrac: piston ring friction is linear with diameter mostly.

15:38 < kludge> magic_ninja: probably not, but I would use a separate mono amp anyway.  That would also allow you to send two audio 
                signals to two places at once.  Amplifiers are cheap these days.
15:38 -!- nicksrv is now known as joerg
15:39 < magic_ninja> Alright. You just dropped a lot of knowledge on me. I'm just a bit lost.
15:39 < kludge> magic_ninja: you want to send a mono sum to the outside feed... you don't want people to hear the strings and not the 
                horns.
15:39 < xentrac> CloudEvil: what about piston ring leakage?
15:39 < kludge> magic_ninja: get the yamaha sound reinforcement book and read the 70V section, it is very useful!
15:39 < CloudEvil> xentrac: As long as oil is involved, it's not an issue
15:40 < xentrac> hm
15:40 < magic_ninja> So, if I have a 5.1 channel amp for the speakers, are you saying that I should connect the outside speakers to one 
                     of the channels?
15:40 < CloudEvil> xentrac: But oil+steam is its own issue
15:40 < xentrac> oh?
15:40 < magic_ninja> I just want to step back just a tad bit if that's okay.
15:40 < kludge> magic_ninja: but what I am thinking is:  line level source --> power amp w/70v output --> cable --> L-pad --> more cable 
                --> speakers
15:40 < xentrac> I wonder if tesla turbines would make more sense at these extremely small scales than they do at larger scales, since 
                 they prefer laminar airflow, which becomes the default and then unavoidable as you move into the microfluidic regime
15:42 < xentrac> or muscle-wire motors, which are totally impractical at large scales both because the materials are costly and because 
                 they take forever to cool down

15:42 < magic_ninja> kludge, my thought was to just train the customer to change it over to stereo output when they want to use the 
                     outside speakers. They want to leave the outside speakers off most of the time.

15:44 < xentrac> I'd think the transition to the laminar-flow regime would help with the pipe-friction issue, but I guess you only earn 
                 that bonus once
