Suppose you are moving a tool of some unknown, but static, geometry
around a workpiece that also has unknown and static geometry, and you
have a thing rigged up that stops motion when they touch, and tells
you.  And you have a high-resolution positional feedback system that
tells you what the relative positions are.
