Apples to Apples is a popular party game; as Wikipedia previously
explained it:

> Each player is dealt seven “red apple” cards; on each is printed a
> noun or noun phrase (Madonna, Lightning, Socks, Mahatma Gandhi,
> Street Gangs, London, The Universe, A Locker Room, The San Andreas
> Fault, Science Fiction, etc.).
> 
> One player is appointed as the first “judge”. She draws a “green
> apple” card on which is printed an adjective (Scary, Smelly,
> Patriotic, Rich, Aged, etc.), and places it face-up. Each of the
> other players places (face down) one of his red apple cards which he
> feels matches the green apple card. The judge shuffles the red apple
> cards then turns them face up (without knowing who submitted each)
> and chooses the one she feels is the best match for the green apple
> card. The player who submitted that red apple card wins the round,
> and takes the green apple card to signify the win.
