(2 minutes)</div><p>Looking at PDF, whose syntax derives from PostScript, I’m struck by
the fact that a lot of its constructs are most easily parsed right to
left.  An object reference like <code>16 0 R</code> starts with an integer
object, and so you end up having to backtrack if you’re using a PEG
parser.</p>
<p>If instead you parse it right to left, you don’t have this problem as
much; the R announces that you are looking at an object reference, and
it contains the following two integers.  Similarly, in a content
stream, you may encounter a text object like Example 1 from §9.2.2 of
the PDF 1.7 spec, ISO 32000-1:2008:</p>
<pre><code>BT
   /F13 12 Tf
   288 720 Td
   (ABC) Tj
ET
</code></pre>
<p>As an S-expression, this is <code>(text (font 'F13 12) (pos 288 720) (paint
"ABC"))</code>; <code>Tf</code> is the operator that sets the font, <code>Td</code> is the
operator that sets the position, and <code>Tj</code> is an operator that draws
text.  Reading this backwards, it’s trivial to predict what you’re
going to have to parse; reading it forwards, you either need to
maintain a stack of pending values like 288 and 720, or do a lot of
backtracking.</p>
<p>However, individual tokens in here are more easily read forwards;
<code>/F13</code> looks like an integer if you look at its last 0, 1, or 2
characters, and perhaps like an operator if you only look at its last
3.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get PEG-like memoization for an asymptotic
performance guarantee and flexibility, while maintaining a LALR-like
stack of bottom-up items that can tell us what parses to even attempt?
Is that even a meaningful question?</p><script src="../liabilities/addtoc.js"></script><div><h2>Topics</h2><ul><li><a href="../topics/programming.html">Programming</a> (49 notes)
