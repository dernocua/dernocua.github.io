Electrolytic machining of glass may be feasible, using a sort of
micro-scale variant of the chlor-alkali process in which the
alkali-producing anode directs a stream of dilute near-boiling aqueous
alkali against the glass, corroding its surface into soluble sodium
silicate which is immediately washed away, carrying the ionic current
toward the anode.
